first heard movie purchasing flick snuff told devil experiment much better naturally went ahead ordered guinea pig box set really interested hear charlie sheen come trying ban either movie second one interest peaked devil experiment short film story character development men torturing woman minutes torture various ways like beating spinning circles forcing drink alcohol forcing listen hi pitched noise hours smash hand mallet burning putting maggots burns throwing guts ultimately shoving sharp needle eye must say lot movie fake like beating scenes actually well done far grossing scenes woman spun around circles making dizzy watching scene forced listen sharp noise hours painful think worst eye scene shutter watching simply thought damn looks pretty good low budget movie enjoy flick know really recommend unless seen horror genre offer
first installment notorious horror series presented snuff film discovered producers set like amateur camcorder tape complete digital timer bottom frame presents woman kidnapped gang black clad men torture several days finally killing hapless victim beaten savagely pelted raw meat fingernails pulled pliers hand smashed hammer eye punctured needle forth nauseating scene woman captors burn hot water drop live maggots burns series received great deal publicity american actor charlie sheen believing series contain actual murder attempted ban distribution united states fbi investigation revealed films appeared viewers sick creations using nasty obvious special effects gruesomely staged acclaimed japanese comic book artist hideshi hino also directed third fourth episodes film sure way clear tolerant rooms gorehounds probably find anything special
say film hasnt already said well tell truth alot looks fake like slaps kicks charlie sheen though real dont know im sure would hitting kicking alot harder however scenes pinching hot oil look real final needle eye scene amazingly done probibly thing film ever shocked
first installment notorious horror series presents woman kidnapped gang black clad men torture several days finally killing beaten savagely spun around chair endlessly finger nails pulled animal guts thrown hot boiling water poured finally eyeball punctured needle really sick nasty scene makers unforgettable torture show tried make real possible one closest thing snuff film get without committing murder tape course special effects rather poor idea making snuff pretty gruesome seen also flowers flesh blood gory sadistic less disturbing anyway one must see horror fans
first supposed brilliant thought provoking film like many reviewers seem compare first review says something along lines anyone likes knows nothing horror cinema apparently way around one look back film really meant convincing low budget ipecac really thats aiming meant blow viewers away sheer shock value flaws visuals much less noticeable back original vhs versions gave one high score reached goal even though downright horrific non shock sense make slightly sick thoroughly paranoid pessimistic trust anyone week want wake strung tortured

long one favourite adaptations austen novel although definitely category spectacular pride prejudice emma lush relatively faithful tv version austen novel especially considering short length biggest change novel movie good one unnecessary snobbishness austen exhibits end story removed replaced someone much akin emma character rest book thought characters chosen portray roles well picked kate beckinsale walks fine line girlishness social snob grace completely lost gwyneth paltrow version samantha morton wispy blonde locks suit attitude character simper accompanies role previous characterisations replaced harriet know book mister knightly role carried extremely well opinion seriousness gentle compassion hero painted novel present much neglected sumptuous film

talk blast opening trampa infernal coolest opening credits ever guided musical tones perhaps slightly inspired legendary friday th theme tsh tsh tsh ha ha ha names lead players appear screen split giant syllables promising intro totally obscure mexican slasher backwoods survival thriller becomes cooler every minute passes two extremely competitive testosterone overloaded paintball enemies challenge ultimate showdown sleazy bar according newspaper article savage bear loose nearby woods already killed multiple hunters tried catch challenge includes whoever kills bear declared ultimate macho hero biggest set balls upon arrival however quickly becomes obvious bear bewildered utterly maniacal war veteran quite arsenal weapons hideout numerous combat tricks sleeve whole decade tame derivative american slashers early mexican effort looks feels refreshing vivid formula simplistic efficient lead characters plausible enough building towards confrontations sadist killer reasonably suspenseful maniac must fan freddy krueger michael myers also uses self made glove sharp knives attached white mask cover face murders pleasingly nasty barbaric really hoping since awesome aforementioned opening sequences waste whole lot gratuitous blood forestry setting particularly camouflaged booby traps joyously spectacular trampa internal mexican slasher survival sleeper hit comes warmly recommended fans genre
think one greatest movies ever made seen many book better still good movie
ambient production failed primary goal correctly adapt allende novel obviously yes bille august managed make superficial shallow film basic elements south american mentality presented simply side events resulting total incoherency believe whole production team could understand book course technical quality film think actors best hands something missing something important part
perhaps best isabel allende book house spirits describes alternative chilean history one full magic mystic veil plus kind omnipresent sadness movie gathers great cast plus great art direction script cannot contain book quality unusual nearly unknown country like chile get well represented movie whose perhaps sin aim high left illiterate public little upset mostly understood little
