homelessness or houselessness as george carlin stated has been an issue for years but never a plan to help those on the street that were once considered human who did everything from going to school work or vote for the matter most people think of the homeless as just a lost cause while worrying about things such as racism the war on iraq pressuring kids to succeed technology the elections inflation or worrying if they ll be next to end up on the streets but what if you were given a bet to live on the streets for a month without the luxuries you once had from a home the entertainment sets a bathroom pictures on the wall a computer and everything you once treasure to see what it s like to be homeless that is goddard bolt s lesson mel brooks who directs who stars as bolt plays a rich man who has everything in the world until deciding to make a bet with a sissy rival jeffery tambor to see if he can live in the streets for thirty days without the luxuries if bolt succeeds he can do what he wants with a future project of making more buildings the bet s on where bolt is thrown on the street with a bracelet on his leg to monitor his every move where he can t step off the sidewalk he s given the nickname pepto by a vagrant after it s written on his forehead where bolt meets other characters including a woman by the name of molly lesley ann warren an ex dancer who got divorce before losing her home and her pals sailor howard morris and fumes teddy wilson who are already used to the streets they re survivors bolt isn t he s not used to reaching mutual agreements like he once did when being rich where it s fight or flight kill or be killed while the love connection between molly and bolt wasn t necessary to plot i found life stinks to be one of mel brooks observant films where prior to being a comedy it shows a tender side compared to his slapstick work such as blazing saddles young frankenstein or spaceballs for the matter to show what it s like having something valuable before losing it the next day or on the other hand making a stupid bet like all rich people do when they don t know what to do with their money maybe they should give it to the homeless instead of using it like monopoly money or maybe this film will inspire you to help others 
brilliant over acting by lesley ann warren best dramatic hobo lady i have ever seen and love scenes in clothes warehouse are second to none the corn on face is a classic as good as anything in blazing saddles the take on lawyers is also superb after being accused of being a turncoat selling out his boss and being dishonest the lawyer of pepto bolt shrugs indifferently i m a lawyer he says three funny words jeffrey tambor a favorite from the later larry sanders show is fantastic here too as a mad millionaire who wants to crush the ghetto his character is more malevolent than usual the hospital scene and the scene where the homeless invade a demolition site are all time classics look for the legs scene and the two big diggers fighting one bleeds this movie gets better each time i see it which is quite often
