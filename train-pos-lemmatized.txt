just two comment seven year apart hard evid of the film s relentless pull power a ha been mention the low budget telemovi status of gantri row is a mitig factor in it limit appeal have said that howev the thing is not without merit either a entertain or a a fright outing per se true the plot at it most basic is a re work of the amityvill horror onli without much horror more a case of intrigu gibney might have made a more worthwhil impress if she had play halifax investig a coupl of seem unconnect murder with the hous a the main suspect the script is better than averag and the product overal of a high standard it just fail to engag the viewer particular at key moment have pick the dvd up for a mere last week at my regular video store i cannot begrudg the expenditur would be an accept price for the film just don t expect firework 
 
 
 
what s inexplic first the hatr toward this movi it may not be the greatest movi of all time but gimm a break it got oscar for a reason it made eighteen hundr million dollar for a reason it s a damn good movi which bring to the other inexplic aspect of it i have no idea whatsoev whi this movi left such an impress on me when i saw it in theater i ve rewatch it on tv and video and it had none of the impact it had when i saw it on the big screen twice or mayb three time actual but that might be it the appeal of it it s a movi yes capit m there it s an epic it s a spectacl in the order of gone with the wind or ben hur now ben hur and gone with the wind seem kinda hokey to me with the hammi act and excess melodrama not that titan ha none of that well the act wa actual veri good the melodrama wa quit heavi hand at time but the reason titan work is that it s such an emot ride i usual enjoy movi that stimul the mind or give me a visual thrill this movi isn t exact dumb but it s not cerebr at all the visual thrill are simpli mean to an end to fuel the emot of the audienc i didn t cri when bambi s mom die i don t react to tearjerk but this is a tearjerk to the power of ten million an emot rollercoast that if it were a regular one would make buzz aldrin scream like a littl girl and i m sure that if you see it on video and have decid that you hate it and have a readi suppli of cynic then you can thorough dislik this movi but if you let that disbelief suspend just a bit if you give this epic melodrama the benefit of the doubt you ll enjoy it complet and look at the top ten gross film of all time is a singl one of them bad is a singl one of them worth a score of out of no not even the phantom menac and this movi made billion dollar worldwid it can t be bad not possibl p s how can anyon even consid compar this to spiderman spiderman wa a fun movi but it wa a total kneejerk that caus it to gross a much a it did it simpli wasn t anyth all that special no one will rememb it in year but i m pretti sure titan will be rememb

while not a wild and way out a some of takashi miik s later film this is a veri good crime drama the basic stori is the stori of a cop of japanes cop with chine parent tri to take down an up and come chine mobster complic thing is that his younger brother is act a the lawyer for the villain and his gang the film is actual much more complic than that with sever complic which both keep thing interest and distract thing from the central narrat thrust it this complic and loss of way about an hour into the film that make this le than a great film it is a veri veri good one this is definit worth see especi if you don t mind a no frantic pace a word of warn the violenc when it happen is explos and nasti there are also semi graphic depict of gay sex if that not your cup of tea proceed with caution or out of 
 
 
 
shinjuku triad societi albeit from perfect is a fierc compel film for what it tri to depict in it uber convent realm it s a yakuza triad pictur involv cop versus japanes or chine gangster most chine a the titl suggest but alreadi even in his first technic debut takashi miik is alreadi establish mani aspect to film that he would make from here on in social issu like black market trade of precious good in this case human organ usual from child nostalgia for childhood and one s root which wa especi preval in dead or aliv thumb of the nose at taboo like gay sex and satir rape violenc toward woman blood curdl violenc it s certain not a surreal a some of miik s most recent film but this is expect a he s tri out thing that he s just start to learn follow a track record of straight to video programm it s got all of those qualiti and it s also like the film that would follow from it equal savag and heartfelt crazi in spot and sardon in it drama and solid for genr fan the stori concern two brother one a chine orphan rais in japan tatsuhito kiriya kippei shiina pretti decent a a eastwood esquir anti hero hero who s becom a detect and anoth who s becom a gangster or a would be one the main arch like takeov gang come from wang a definit pun on what the gang repres dure it spare time play by tomorowo taguchi a a typic wacko with real terror in his eye and his partner karino takeshi caesar who s threaten even when just repeat a command over and over to a woman who s just had her eye plug out follow a sour deal who are the ruthless kind to pop up almost organ in a miik movi there s some intrigu involv the organ trade scheme with the gangster which kiriya almost becom a victim of and the gang s penchant for gay sex at least with one littl puppet of sort who doe whatev the main gangster want it all lead up to vengeanc and redempt qualiti that miik and his writer are tri to emul from shakespear henc the macbeth bit with wang wash his bloodi hang over and over after some gay sex say it won t come off if it doesn t add up to the same emot level of impact that a great shakespear play would have it s par for the cours of a film like this miik s goal are met though just met in his low scale ambit a gangster pictur with some ad level of harsh famili troubl the main tension between the brother come out of profess and duti to parent note on the crueler aspect of underworld crime and what the realm of unrepent sex with both sex bring out psycholog in the charact at the same time shinjuku triad societi also contain more than a few moment of classic bite black comedi from the miik oeuvr some of it just ha to be taken with a grain of salt for what the director doe in his outrag like the bit at the begin with the chair smash over the face or the random of the interrog a it goe into a veri twist area there s even a laugh out loud line from the young sex slave after finish an act on one of the bos thank you mr weeni burger miik and his writer don t have enough here to make the film a full on dark comedi like ichi or of cours visitor q but there s enough to bring some appropri leviti to the darker aspect to the stori and charact a the first entri of the black societi trilog a it s call i wa quit impress and it s a fine quasi call card from one of the craziest new artist in contemporari cinema 
 
 
 
a lot ha been said about shinjuku triad societi a the first true miik film and i thought this sort of descript might have been a clich but like all clich s it is base on the truth all the miik trademark are here the violenc the black humour the homosexu the taboo test and the difficult to like central charact shinjuku is howev one of miik s most perfect form film he say in an interview that if he made it again it would be differ but not necessarili better i think what he mean is that the film posse a truli captiv energi and raw edg which seem so fresh that although he might be abl to captur a more visual or technic complex movi he could not replic or better the puriti of this film a you might expect the violenc is utter viscer gush blood and gritti beat are supplement by a fantast scene in which a woman ha a chair smash over her face onli a miik film could let you get away with a sentenc like that the film ha a fantast pace unlik dead or aliv which begin and end strong and dip in the middl dead or aliv also deal with similar issu miik is clear concern about the relat between the japanes and chine in the postwar period and this emot subject is handl well here the central charact realli come to life when you begin to understand his past i cannot sing shinjuku s prais enough i do not want to give away too much this is miik befor he began to use cgi to anim his film and is almost reminisc of someth like kitano s sonatin the central charact are superbl realiz and the final twist guarante that a soon a the film ha finish you ll be pop it back on again to work it all out 
 
 
 
this wa the begin of it all grant this is not friend at it best but this wa the show s pilot let s not forget and not a bad one at that we re introduc to the gang and central perk where our stori begin even from this first episod we get a sign of the ross rachel relationship that will come over the next ten year when ross say i just want to be marri again and rachel storm in with a wed dress on probabl not intent a at the time the writer were go for a monica joey relationship but fit nice now when look back someth el in this episod rachel is introduc to chandler a if the two have never met befor but in later episod the so call flashback this is contradict a the two have met on three previous occas nevertheless the point is this a fine start to a great show this episod may not be the usual friend a we are accustom to them with the cast still a bit inexperienc but over the next few episod we see whi the show came to be what it wa keep watch first season is a blast 
 
 
 
here it is the first ever episod of friend where we get introduc to control freak monica gellar courtney cox newli divorc ross gellar david schimmer hippi pheob buffay lisa kudrow unknown actor and ladi man matt le blanc and veri sarcast chandler bing matthew perri this is how the scene start off until we introduc to the th and final friend spoilt kid rachel green jennif aniston the episod is better than most peopl give credit for like ani new sitcom the first episod isn t alway fantast the act in this episod isn t great becaus the cast cannot identifi and arnt realli believ in their new charact apart from kudrow and perri who shine matt le blanc man his act wa down right dread becaus until later he get more confid but i think he tri to be funni but at most fail david schimmer whi doe he over pronounc everi word he cannot speak normal but he becam one of the funniest charact in later season but he isn t confid and i cannot sympathis with him jennif aniston look hot and doe a good job a rachel green but we onli see the real rachel later in the st season courtney cox look quit anorex in this episod it worri she look total differ now more healthili she act is a littl sketchi but everyon is in this minut pilot lisa kudrow and matthew perri i m do these two togeth becaus their comic time and act qualiti wa superb and for lisa this wa one of her first role and she is so natur a pheob pheeb and matthew perri is just matthew perri play himself basic the episod qualiti doe improv later such a the set they look dark and creepi in this episod and make them seem unfriend the act is ok the charact gain confid with each new scene and i am proud this is the pilot i hope we see the friend reunit caus they will alway be there for u 
 
 
 
and that s how the greatest comedi of tv start it ha been year sinc the veri first episod but it ha continu with the same spirit till the veri last season becaus that s where friend is base on quot extraordinari situat are take place among six friend who will never leav from our heart let s say a big thank to rachel ross monica joey chandler and phoeb in our first meet we see how rachel dump a guy in the church how understand monica s search for the perfect guy there is no perfect guy whi all you woman are ob with that and how your marriag can be ruin when the partner of your life discov that she s a lesbian till we meet joey phoeb and chandler in the next episod enjoy friend 
 
 
 
in this first episod of friend we are introduc to the main charact of the seri monica geller phoeb buffay chandler bing ross geller joey tribbiani and eventu rachel green we discov that rachel a rich girl that is monica s friend from high school time left her fianc barri at the altar sinc she discov she didn t love him she also decid to live with monica and becom independ from her father get a new job a a waitress in central perk ross for the other hand discov his wife is a lesbian and lost her for susan her partner we see him move to a new apart dure the episod monica in this episod make out and eventu sleep with paul the wine guy who gave her the excus of be impot sinc he divorc his wife but in realiti he wa just deceiv her p i just loooov joey s and chandler s haircut in this first season 
 
 
 
what start out a a veri predict and somewhat drab affair is in the end quit hilari and entertain right to die is not veri suspens but it more than make up for that with some outlandish set piec and over the top gore spoiler here top credit also go to the dead on perform from martin donovan a one of the most despic charact ever to grace the screen play the charact in a great aloof fashion you near feel bad for the guy in the end when his grand plan ultim fail corbin bernsen also chew up the sceneri play a not so good guy who get his just dessert end of spoiler a a reveng from the dead flick right to die benefit heavili from it s perform and is more than an ok way to spend le than an hour 
 
 
 
this is one of the best episod from the second season of moh i think mick garri ha a problem with woman he kill em all they are often the victim screwfli solut pro life valeri on the stair i don t rememb the argento s episod in season etc obvious imprint i think he enjoy to watch woman been burn tortur mutil and i don t know never least right to die is one of the best with good turn and graphic scene and suspens special with the photo from the cell scene wonder the act is like the entir seri regular i could be worst like pro life or we scream for ice cream also i think the plot it could be made for a movi and not just for an episod the ideolog of the seri is horribl kill and termin woman mutil anim and on and on the first season it wa better than the second one with episod like cigarrett burn the best of all homecom the most funni imprint realli shock 
 
 
 
i m not entir sure rob schmidt qualifi a a master in the genr of horror sinc he previous just direct one horror film call wrong turn and that one wa actual just wa slight abov mediocr but fact is that he made with right to die one of the best and creepiest episod of the entir second season of the master of horror franchis there wa a similar underdog stori in season one when william malon made on of the best episod with the fair hair child even though his other long featur film fear dot com and hous on haunt hill suck pretti bad the stori of right to die clever pick in on the nowaday pipe hot social debat of euthanasia but thank also featur multipl old fashion horror theme like ghost vengeanc murder conspiraci pitch black humor and comic book style violenc whilst drive home late one night and discus the husband s continu adulteri the addison coupl are involv in a terribl car accid cliff walk away from the wreck unharm but his wife abbi is fulli burn and need to be kept aliv artifici whilst cliff and his sleazi attorney corbin bernsen of the dentist want to plug the plug on her and sue the car constructor abbey s mum set up a giant medium campaign to keep her daughter aliv a a veget and blame everyth on cliff meanwhil abbey s hate spirit come back for reveng and kill someon in cliff s surround whenev she ha a near fatal experi with the medic devic after a few victim cliff realiz it might be safer for him to keep his wife aliv if he want to remain aliv a well right to die is a stupend episod and exact the type of stuff i alway hope to see from a tv seri concept like master of horror it s violent and gori with a sick twist sen of humor and load of sleaz sequenc the euthanasia theme and the whole obligatori medium circus that surround it is process into the script veri well yet without unnecessarili revert to polit standpoint or moral lesson the atmospher is suspens and the kill sequenc are suitabl nasti and unsettl actress julia anderson and robin sydney both have pretti face and impress voluptu rack which is alway a welcom plus and corbin bernsen is final offer the chanc again to depict a mean spirit and egocentr bastard great moh episod definit one of the highlight of both season 
 
 
 
well it about time i had realli given up ani and all hope that there wa go to be a standout episod among this season s entri while there have still been far too mani drab to hohum entri at least this episod turn out well it rather funni that director rob schmidt who onli ha the not bad wrong turn to his credit and writer john esposito whose onli script chore to date have includ tale of the mummi and graveyard shift should be the one to give u the best written and most thought provok episod of the season in right to die we are treat to the stori of cliff and abbey at the start of the episod the coupl are have a convers abbey ha caught cliff cheat and he is desper tri to win her back while they speak they find themselv in a car accid where cliff is left with onli scratch and bruis but abbey is thrown from the car and catch on fire when a spark ignit and gasolin that had drip onto her catch her on fire and this is just the setup peopl onc in the hospit cliff must decid whether or not abbey should live in this state with no skin and onli nerv reflex there s also a side effect too everi time she flatlin abbey goe a walk a a ghost and caus troubl for all sort of peopl hand down this is the best episod of the season and certain rank a one of the top episod ever from the gruesom effect to the taut script which threw in a few twist i never saw come and suspens so palpabl you can almost touch it right to die should have the right to go on live forev 
 
 
 
but the fun is in the journey i found this movi to be extrem enjoy not onli are both lead extrem easi on the eye the humor from the support cast and the joke actual made me laugh out loud sever time yes it s predict and yes it s a clich romant comedi but the point is that it s a sweet stori the messag about find your one true love also ring true in mani way the dialog is dead on and the act is well done on all part and over the top for comic effect the bulgari scene is worth it s weight in gold the actress there deserv honor mention for those that pan it for be predict if you want a film with twist and turn that keep you guess then you want a thriller this is a romant comedi it touch my heart and made me realiz that i wa lucki enough to find my true love in life and it ha been worth everi effort along the way great date movi great movi for a happi cri

this is the first michael vartan movi i ve seen i haven t seen alia and i wa curious to see if the guy can act he sure can and is likabl in this movi natasha henstridg is of cours gorgeous but she is usual in more physic and action role so i found her veri good and lovabl in this differ sweet role of a schoolteach some of the negat comment i read are true the movi is full of clich s and the stori doesn t ring true at all also even though everi charact in the movi remark how good they look togeth i don t think there is screen chemistri there howev i enjoy this movi the local are nice the charact are likabl and goodlook and the support actor are pretti good if you are expect to see a great romanc this is not it but if you want to see a pleasant innoc goodlook movi with likabl charact it veri good 
 
 
 
i just can t understand the negat comment about this film yes it is a typic boy meet girl romanc but it is done with such flair and polish that the time just fli by henstridg talk about win the gene pool lotteri is a magnet and allur a ever who say the golden age of cinema is dead and vartan hold his own there is simmer chemistri between the two lead the film is most aliv when they share a scene lot it is done so well that you find yourself will them to get togeth ignor the negat comment if you are feel a bit blue watch this flick you will feel so much better if you are alreadi happi then you will be euphor p i am male from the uk and a hopeless romant still search for his princess

this had a good stori it had a nice pace and all charact are develop cool i ve watch a whole bunch of movi in the last two week and this had to be the best one i ve seen in the two week jason bigg s charact wa the best though even though it wa small it wa clever craft from the veri begin this may be a romant comedi and i don t like most but the write direct perform sound design overal in all capac just wa realli thought out pretti cool this film score pretti high out of all the movi s i ve seen late and the rest were big budget or better public good job in write 
 
 
 
this is a great film i agre to watch a chick flick and some how end up with this i had never heard of it or anyon in it excpet mike from friend but it is great eva lake and paul give amaz perform the humour is consist dri and witti paul rudd pretti much play the mike charact from friend which work great the other charact are stereotyp and the plot is formula i mean we are not talk apocalyps now here but the charact are likabl the stori is engag the soundtrack product and direct all work well in all a great feel good film that realli deserv a lot more credit than it get everyon ha their own tast but i realli don t understand the one star review for this 
 
 
 
i watch this on an hour flight and presum becaus of the pressur and the altitud i actual found it mild entertain emphasi on the mild the actual idea behind the film wa brilliant a woman die her fianc fall in love with someon el she decid to make sure they don t get togeth but eventu she let them do it sad the actual film wasn t a good ok there were a few laugh and the actor all work well but from the begin the plot wa about a predict a the destin of the flight i wa on i think the whole gay but not gay friend part of the stori could have been work a lot better the talk parrot wa a nice idea but to be honest it wasn t realli veri funni in summari the film wa more interest than stare at the seat in front of me but it wa a close call 
 
 
 
over her dead bodi wa a nice littl movi it wa decent and entertain while still be pretti funni there were a few clich s but i found most stuff fresh at first i didn t think it wa go to be good at all when it start out if you can get past the first minut though the movi start get more interest this film wasn t burst out in laughter hilari and wasn t oh my gosh wonder it wa just a movi that you can sit down and enjoy for how enjoy it wa i don t see how this movi wa bad it s rate is just a bit too low i could ve dealt with a but a also give this movi a is disgrac it wa pretti good and there wa noth horribl enough about it to give it a which is what most peopl gave it

this wa a person favorit of mine when i wa young it had everyth that wa great with s kid movi lovabl dinosaur cute kid an eccentr villain and a few great song and not the typic littl mermaid beauti and the beast type song but one that are atual entertain i ran into this movi again recent and i still love it a much a ever i recommend that everyon of everi age should see this movi and i definit think that it should be introduc to the younger generat sorri not the most inform i m in kinda a rush just plea trust me all who go against this movi are kill their inner child 
 
 
 
i first heard of this movi after purchas the flick snuff i wa told that devil s experi wa much better so natur i went ahead and order the guinea pig box set i wa realli interest to hear that charli sheen had come out tri to ban either this movi or the second one so my interest wa peak devil s experi is a short film with no stori no charact develop just men tortur a woman for about minut they tortur her in various way like beat her spin her in circl over and over again then forc her to drink alcohol forc her to listen to hi pitch nois for hour smash her hand with a mallet burn and put maggot on the burn throw gut at her and ultim shove a sharp needl through her eye i must say that a lot of this movi wa fake like the beat scene but then some of it wa actual well done a far a gross you out the scene in which the woman is be spun around in circl wa make me dizzi watch it or the scene in which she is forc to listen to sharp nois for hour is pain to think about the worst is the eye scene i didn t shutter when watch it but simpli thought damn that look pretti good for such a low budget movi i did enjoy the flick but i don t know if i can realli recommend this unless you have seen most of what the horror genr ha to offer 
 
 
 
the first instal of this notori horror seri is present a if it were a snuff film discov by the produc and set up like an amateur camcord tape complet with a digit timer at the bottom of the frame it present a woman be kidnap by a gang of black clad men who tortur her for sever day befor final kill her the hapless victim is beaten savag and pelt with raw meat befor have her fingernail pull out with plier her hand smash with a hammer her eye punctur with a needl and so forth in the most nauseat scene the woman s captor burn her with hot water and drop live maggot into the burn the seri receiv a great deal of public when american actor charli sheen believ the seri to contain actual murder attempt to ban it distribut in the unit state an fbi investig reveal that the film were onli what they appear to be to most viewer sick re creation use nasti but obvious special effect gruesom stage by acclaim japanes comic book artist hideshi hino who also direct the third and fourth episod this film is a sure way to clear all but the most toler of room but gorehound probabl won t find anyth special 
 
 
 
what can i say about this film that hasnt alreadi been said well to tell the truth alot of it look veri fake like some of the slap and the kick how charli sheen though this wa real i dont know im sure they would be hit and kick her alot harder if it wa howev the scene with the pinch and the hot oil look veri real and the final needl in the eye scene is amaz done and is probibl the onli thing on film that ha ever shock me 
 
 
 
the first instal of this notori horror seri present a woman be kidnap by a gang of black clad men who tortur her for sever day befor final kill her she is beaten savag spun around in the chair endless ha her finger nail pull anim gut are thrown at her hot boil water is pour on her and final her eyebal is punctur with a needl realli sick and nasti scene the maker of this unforgett tortur show tri to make it a real a possibl and for me this one is the closest thing to a snuff film you can get without commit murder on tape of cours some of the special effect are rather poor but the idea of make a snuff is pretti gruesom i have seen also flower of flesh and blood which is more gori and sadist but le disturb anyway this one is a must see for horror fan 
 
 
 
first off this is not suppos to be a brilliant and thought provok film like so mani other review seem to compar it to the first review say someth along the line of anyon who like this know noth about horror cinema appar it the other way around if one were to look back after the film it realli wasn t meant to be convinc it wa a low budget ipecac but realli that all it wa aim for it wa meant to blow viewer away with sheer shock valu and all the flaw it it visual were much le notic back in the origin vhs version i gave this one a high score becaus it reach it goal and even though it wa not downright horrif in non shock sen it did make me slight sick and thorough paranoid pessimist i didn t trust anyon for about a week becaus i didn t want to wake up strung up and tortur 
 
 
 
just the ultim masterpiec in my opinion everi line everi phrase everi pictur is exact in place and lindsay crous and joe mantegna are just the cool shrink and the sleazi con man so well cast out of 
 
 
 
uniqu movi about confus woman lindsay crous who get involv with sharp con men joe mantegna give an oscar calib perform a the slickest of the group absolut enchant first hour a mantegna show crous the rope of his con game stori line unravel a bit later on but still stand a a uniqu portray of an innoc caught up in a dark world definit worth a shot 
 
 
 
in the spirit of the classic the sting this movi hit where it truli hurt in the heart a prim proper femal psychiatrist hungri for adventur meet up with the dirtiest and rottenest of scoundral the vulner doctor fall for the career badman and beg to be involv in his oper while the movi move kind of slow it s climax and end are stun you ll especi enjoy how the doctor forgiv herself 
 
 
 
i m a big fan of film where peopl get con and hous of game is almost the pinnacl of the film where peopl get con genr in short it s an except thriller that keep you on the edg of your seat by provid interest charact with mani level and never truli reveal what s happen while throw in mani twist and surpris to upset complet what you ve just seen the film con the audienc on mani occas and despit u know this it s still difficult to guess where it s go and everi twist come off a a surpris a mention i m a big fan of con in movi and the plot of this one follow a femal psychiatrist who receiv a patient with a huge debt owe to a fellow gambler she then goe to the gambler in an attempt to help out her patient and on the way get drawn into the art of read peopl in order to pull off a con hous of game breath a sleazi atmospher throughout and david mamet doe well in establish his film s set in the underground level of the citi the film is well act also with all concern bring life and believ to their charact with the greatest of skill joe mantegna star a the con man at the heart of the film and although his perform is a littl under wrought he s alway solid and believ a the villain of the piec lindsay crous star alongsid him a the psychiatrist seduc by his work and again is believ in her role she may not be the greatest looker but at least she can act the way that the film execut it s plot is the main star of the show howev and you will no doubt be amaz on multipl occas a to how the film constant manag to amaz and deceiv the viewer at time it s almost like we are in the thick of the action and be con by the con men in the film anoth thing that s great about this film is the way that it show the audienc how to pull off certain con which is use if you re interest in make twenti buck say all in all hous of game is a truli first rate thrill ride 
 
 
 
spoiler this is a grip movi about grifter but who is con who here when doe the hunter turn into the prey this gritti dark movi is slow move and seduct it pull you in and drag you down the proverbi garden path onli to waylay you just a you think you are safe it ha a rivet script with good act at least from the lead i didn t notic the background music but it wa never jar so it must have been done right i wa veri surpris that i like this movi becaus i don t usual go for this genr but this one suck me in and kept he hook until the end 
 
 
 
open the film with a bach toccata is an aural hint of what is to unfold in this intens drama all the composit devic bach perfect to keep his listen and the perform intrigu and entertain appli to this film there isn t a mutual tender between the two lead charact and the lead femal in the final scene i feel is justifi in state she wa rape even though her victim feel she wa forewarn that he wa a cad mamet compel explor the emot chasm and differ between the gender but i feel he is clueless about how they actual compliment one anoth given a healthi sen of humor if mamet ever develop a healthi humor take on the interact between the gender i wonder how this work would have end a it exist it is veri somber and mean spirit 
 
 
 
 hous of game is definit not without it flaw plot hole stiff act final scene but they do littl to detract from the fun of watch a thriller that so method mess with your head hous of game doe almost everyth a good thriller is suppos to do of cours this is not a huge feat given the fact that we re deal with the the world of confid men and the con they perpetr so it stand to reason that we never realli know what s go on even though we think that we do but that s what make the film worthwhil for those who are game a film for which repeat view are indulg instead if necess it ha a definit hitchcock slant to it the film draw on some similar theme found his effort marni consid a misfir when releas but now regard a one of the master s more thought provok work one could easili consid the idea of lindsay crous s charact be the same a tippi hedrin s ten year later perhap both are strong will loner both with compuls behavior which compel them to walk too close to the shark pool a crous s repress up tight charact say what s life without adventur put your realiti check on a low set and enjoy swim with the shark 
 
 
 
i m not great at write review so i ll just spout my opinion i love this seri at first the adventur the action the comedi the drama i thought it wa all brilliant anderson tap shank judg davi i love them all davi it seem wa the fifth most import person in the cast not a big deal but when his charact general hammond left at the end of the seventh season and anderson s charact colonel o neill move from the field to the offic the qualiti of the seri sudden fell off a cliff i don t know whether it s becaus hammond wa more import that i realiz or what but for some reason after the seventh season the seri turn to the first seven season though were awesom the movi stargat seem mediocr the first time i saw it but it turn out to be even if this wasn t the origin intent a brilliant setup to the seri i recommend that you watch the movi first then watch the first season of the tv seri then watch the movi again you ll have a whole new appreci of it the second time around believ me and then watch the rest of the tv seri the last three season of the seri aren t near a good a the first seven but that doesn t mean they aren t good it just mean they re a letdown if you ve gotten spoil by the first seven season after you have finish this seri be sure to watch the spin off seri stargat atlanti it is a worthi successor to this brilliant seri edit on i just found out that don s davi die a few week ago it is a great loss 
 
 
 
hous of game is spell bind it s so nice to occasion see film that are perfect ten there are few movi i ve seen that can grip you so quick from the open scene this movi just get you i m tri realli hard not to give to much away to those who may not yet have seen this but there will be a few spoiler so don t read anymor if you don t want to know i would say hous of game is not just a superb film but is the best movi about con artist i have ever seen bar none from the moment the movi is over it beg to be replay lindsay crous a margaret ford is simpli perfect from her manner to the inflect of her voic she get into the role immedi joe mantegna wa also wonder the dialogu in this movi ha an unforc almost unscript qualiti and these two peopl communic a much in a look a they do with their voic i also love the way the movi wa film in that graini surreal type of way it fit perfect and help make the film what it wa there were a few movi i ve seen and love that this remind me of includ the grifter and the usual suspect but realli hous of game is complet differ in it s way margaret and mike are two of the most absorb charact i ve seen on the big screen and not onli do they have screen chemistri that is strong and palpabl from the moment they meet but the buildup that start from the moment they set eye on each other is electrifi you know someth s go to happen but you have no idea what and just when you think you ve guess what the someth is you realiz you haven t even scratch the surfac hous of game is one of those movi that may be lump in to a certain genr of movi type but is essenti a movi about human natur the charact studi is not just about the mind of the con artist but the victim a well a the movi move along and we get to know more and more about the main charact we learn about them not just through what they say but how they say it it is a great charact studi and is flawless in the way it speed to it s conclus in close i d rank this of call it although not my absolut favorit film pretti high on the list most definit outstand and would go so far a to say it doe rank a one of the best charact studi and contain some of the best twist i ve ever seen a well although i love all type and genr of movi when it come to movi of the human psych it realli doesn t get much better then this see this movi

i have to say from the begin when i watch the stargat movi movi i wasn t blown away or anyth it wa like an averag sci fi movi with a lot of potenti though the movi wasn t a erm amaz a other sci fi movi such a star war or alien which if u are a sci fi fanat u will admit one of those two titl are amaz even though i m not a hardcor sci fi fan a some peopl i don t rememb one line from either of those movi i m not a big fan of wear star war t shirt in fact if you saw me i would look like an averag person to you ah get slight off the point here well my point is that the that you don t have to be a hard core sci fi fan to like this great seri which unfortun end after amaz season with no drop in it qualiti a it got nearer to it end in though i didn t like the movi much i wa quit look forward to the first season in and let me tell you the special effect were onli one of the brilliant thing about the seri the chemistri between the charact just blew me away the special affect were a good if not better than most sci fi show run today i have to admit that i would never have gone into sci fi if it wasn t for stargat and my dad who actual got me into sci fi when i wa like and i m glad he did other wise i wouldn t have seen the brilliant show like sg which now in my opinion set the benchmark for near all sci fi seri and movi basic if a new sci fi seri isn t better or a good a sg it not worth watch basic this is the best sci fi show to date and if you don t watch this then you have no idea what you are miss 
 
 
 
bruce almighti is the best jim carrey work sinc the truman show and wa a pleasant surpris after some of his recent hey hollywood look how good i can act box offic disappoint it s great to see jim recogn and embrac his strength he won t get an academi award but the film itself will last longer than mani of the award film of the academi he is at the top of his form in this most recent film it s like the return of an old friend carrey freeman and aniston all do a great job togeth comfort in their comedi role superb comic time and obvious have fun togeth but without the hey mom look how funni i am type of comedi a real surpris wa steven carrel a carrey s nemesi carrel of the daili show fame who walk away with some the best and funniest scene of the film i laugh harder at carel than anyon el in the past three year i can forese the religi nut in the u will be up in arm over the treatment of god but the bottom line of the film is true to all major theolog belief we are mass of protoplasm tri to get through our short live by exercis our free will without marri with child t o complain about this will like becom a target of peopl with misplac prioriti who know the type men adorn in gold watch on sunday morn and late nigh televis sell prayer to god and again about of the countri will care and of the medium will report it the bottom line this a pure entertain film each audienc member laugh wonder what they would do and a feel good feel at the movi conclus a walk down ani major street in america ha to confirm that god ha a tremend sen of humor what better comic genius to remind u of that than jim carri thank again jim it s great to have you back 
 
 
 
after a slow begin bruce almighti is a veri funni film that had someth posit to say it wasn t one of jim carrey s best perform but he wa still ok morgan freeman wa just right a god jennif aniston had some good moment i miss steve correl on the daili show i like director tom shadyac s choic of movi he also did liar liar patch adam and the nutti professor in all three of those and in bruce almighti he take a big comedi star and tell a human stori with him a director who know comedi can get the talent he get and can tell a meaning and intellig stori with it is hard to find my biggest complaint is that they should have use more biblic refer i onli rememb three specif biblic refer and they were the three funniest part of the whole movi my guess is that the first few draft of the screenplay had more biblic refer but they were cut out becaus the produc were afraid of offend peopl that s too bad becaus i thought it wa a miss opportun my grade out of 
 
 
 
`bruce almighti will sweep the academi award with a record oscar win it will surpass `titan a the highest gross film of all time jim carrey s illustri will be at such a suprem level that he will announc his presidenti candidaci for the white hous playoff almighti then these grandeur fantasi would onli transpir if the filmmak carrey includ would posse the power of god that veri same premis is the paramount ingredi in carrey s new laugh riot `bruce almighti carrey play bruce nolan a televison report who is so utter ob in be the main anchor that he hold god to total culpabl for his own contretemp god heaven play by morgan freeman grant bruce the `gift of god his power in order to challeng him if he can do god s job ani better obvious bruce get `carrey away with his newfound bliss faculti and use them selfish carrey is back in his habitu almighti comed form in `bruce almighti jennif aniston wa not `mis pitti a bruce s girlfriend howev my premier kudo goe to director tom shadyac for not let the dog out of the hous for and show u the most hilari doggon bathroom scene of all time `bruce almighti is not the most in depth carrey film but it is still an almighti chuckl exhibit of `carrey good
 
 
 
jim carrey and morgan freeman along with jennif aniston combin to make one of the funniest movi so far this season late may and a good improv on carrey s past crazi and person forget role in past comedi with a slight tone down carrey antic yet with just the zap and crackl of his old self carrey power carri this movi to the height of laughter and also some dramat tear somber moment element of jim s real act abil continu to show up in this movi this delight summer entertain hit most of the button includ dramat element along with the goofi moment that fit perfect with this script while still lack in the superbl polish ensembl of comedi drama bruce almight deserv credit for be a great date movi along with a solid messag and soft spiritu cynic and parodi that maintain it good natur tast eight out of ten star 
 
 
 
ok so it s not a masterpiec like the godfath but it doesn t have to be the onli purpos this movi ha is to make the viewer laugh sever time if it can make the viewer laugh a bunch of time it ha accomplish it purpos i laugh out loud and left with a smile i feel like i got my money s worth 
 
 
 
well not actual this movi is veri entertain though went and saw it with the girlfriend last night and had to use the i think there might be someth in my eye routin the movi is a great combin of comedi and typic romanc jim carey is superb a a down on his luck report who is given the power to chang himself and the citi in which he resid in fact all the charact are great the movi is not over funni or sappi good flick to go see with the wife all in all note i am not an easi grader that all from bigv over and out 
 
 
 
i for one wa glad to see jim carrey in a film where be over the top wasn t the goal his charact is like all of u want more better thing to happen to u and expect god to deliv morgan freeman made a great god with a sen of humor and a genuin sen of love for each of u yet readi to take a littl vacat when the opportun present itself i thought jennif aniston s charact wa a littl too vulner and understand toward carri s basic self center tv anchorman wanna be but that s the way it wa written i think the preview ruin sever potenti veri funni scene becaus everyon who saw them knew what wa come befor it happen i have read a number of the review and it seem some peopl are look a littl too deep this is a summer comedi and is not meant to solv the problem of the world although there are a few messag we could all take to heart a funni film 
 
 
 
i am a veri big jim carrey fan i laugh my as off dure liar liar and ace ventura i also like him in his serious movi especi truman show this one is a cross between his veri funni side and his serious side he is of cours veri funni in this movi but there are part that are veri serious and he pull it off with a lot of ea he is trueli a multi function actor a for the rest of the cast i wa happi with jennif aniston s act i think she is more than just a coupl of nice tit and great as morgan freeman make a veri cool god a for steven carel his limit scene are veri funni especi in the anchor scene overal i would have to rate this a good act funni script and some veri serious situat make this a veri good film 
 
 
 
i realli do not know what peopl have against this film but it s definit one of my favourit it s not preachi it s not anchor by it s moral it shouldn t be controversi it s just god ani possibl god no matter the religion and it s realli funni jim carri play bruce nolan a tv report usual stuck on the lighter side of the news desper to prove himself more or le to himself that he can be taken serious and do a good job in an anchor job this drive is what is slowli drive his beauti girlfriend grace jennif aniston away when the final straw are execut he s quick to not laugh but yell in the face of god who in turn give bruce his power bruce then make his life better for himself until he s guilt into help other where he then continu to miss the point of his power meanwhil his constant excit about his own life make him more selfish leav his relationship on danger ground ok that wa kinda long but a a plot it work well the step by step fashion in which we meet the challeng of be god is much better than cluster his problem togeth and is abl to hide itself fair well a you probabl know from hear about this movi in the first place carrey s pitch perfect act stay in charact which luckili enough is him and control and give atmospher to the movi scene by scene whether they would admit it or not the role wa written or rewritten exclus for carrey without him the humour would turn flat a humour is half execut and the humour is veri good in the first place but without carrey it would kinda feel like a it s a wonder life wannab jennif aniston is great and no matter what some may say doe not act like the onli excus for the third act at least you don t think that when you see her she give a heartfelt perform and make you forget you re watch a movi she and carrey feel veri much like a real coupl the movi feel ggooooodd see the movi to understand ha a veri nice feel tackl the idea appropri and better than expect and overal should never have been call slap togeth just to save carrey s career which wasn t goin anywher 
 
 
 
well wa morgan freeman ani more unusu a god than georg burn this film sure wa better than that bore oh god i wa total engross and lmao all the way through carrey wa perfect a the out of sort anchorman wannab and aniston carri off her part a the frustrat girlfriend in her usual well play perform i for one don t consid her to be either ugli or untal i think my favorit scene wa when carrey open up the file cabinet think it could never hold his life histori see if you can spot the file in the cabinet that hold the event of his bathroom humor i wa roll over this one well written and even better play out this comedi will go down a one of this funnyman s best 
 
 
 
star jim carrey morgan freeman jennif anniston i wa realli quit skeptic the first time i watch this movi i mean what a conceptu nightmar jim carrey play god noth is sacr anymor well this movi is hard sacr but it also is not sacrilegi at least not to ani great extent yes jim carrey ha the power of god for a while but he is not god confus i ll give you the low down jim carrey play bruce nolan a report who is down on his luck and feel veri unsuccess with his life he live with his beauti girlfriend grace anniston and you can tell right off the bat that they love each other but the relationship is on fair shaki ground then bruce get a shot at anchorman onli to have it underhand stolen by evan baxter obvious not plea bruce share his thought with the world through the televis in a way which is comic and definit worthi of get him fire much complain and gripe about god later bruce get a page after a while he get tire of it call so he respond and goe to the omni present build heh there he meet god freeman who is the bos electrician and janitor of the build i found this high amus god is the bos the holi spirit is the electrician and jesus christ is the janitor think about it bos obvious electrician the guy who keep everyth run janitor the guy who clean up the mess that the world ha left brilliant anyway bruce is a littl skeptic about have actual met god but when god give bruce his power and give him a shot at play god he start to believ a bit wonder whi enter the flagrant abus of power for person gain and to abus the enemi sinc this is hollywood bruce obvious eventu smarten up learn his lesson and start use his power for the good of the world in the end he cri out for god to take it away and pray that his will be done not bruce s sinc it is jim carrey the movi is quit amus and there are definit some high entertain moment in it the movi is not perfect theolog but for hollywood it is definit a good attempt mani statement in the film can be quit thought provok and even challeng and i applaud tom shadyac for his effort in this movi so while far from perfect definit an amus popcorn movi with a littl bit of thought behind it bottom line out of worth a view or two 
 
 
 
jim carrey is back to much the same role that he play in the mask a timid guy who is tri to get ahead in the world but who seem to be plagu with bad luck even when he tri to help a homeless guy from be harass by a bunch of hoodlum and of cours they have to be mexican obvious his good will toward his fellow man backfir in that case it wasn t too hard to predict that he wa about to have a hand of angri hoodlum but i like that the movi suggest that thing like that shouldn t be ignor i m remind of the episod of michael moor s brilliant the aw truth when they had a man lay down on the sidewalk and pretend to be dead and see who would actual stop and make sure he wa okay the result were not veri promis so it s nice to see someon in the movi set a good exampl jim carrey play the part of bruce nolan the nice guy mention abov whose entir life seem to be fall apart or even better it seem to be break up by the blow of bad luck like an asteroid enter the atmospher a littl metaphor that come up when bruce miracul find himself a gigant news stori later in the film bruce is near year old and all he ha to show for it is a posit a a news report of the sort that report on such excit news a the local bakeri that s seek to bake the world s biggest cooki he s desper to obtain the job of head anchor at the tv station but he lose his cool on live tv when he hear that the job went to his rival colleagu you have to love how they time the revel of this news to him second befor his first live report needle to say he lose his temper on live tv in one of the funniest scene of the entir film morgan freeman deliv a fantast perform a the man himself display a god whose infinit wisdom is somewhat reflect through freeman s massiv talent a an actor he is the kind of god who take his job veri serious but in such a way a to advis his follow a well a the viewer of this movi that there are time when you need to slow down and do some manual labor in life i love his line that some of the happiest peopl in the world come home smell to high heaven at the end of the day there are a lot of peopl in the world mayb more than our share in america who are so absorb by their money and their posse and their job and everyth that they complet lost touch with the natur side of themselv a human one of the biggest strength is that the movi is abl to provid great advic to peopl in general about improv their live and this messag is clear and accept regardless of the viewer s religion i for exampl tend to reject organ religion in all form and i see god and satan to be metaphor for differ aspect of natur and human psycholog rather than actual figur who ever live or continu to live but despit the fact that i don t believ that god exist a an entiti overse the univers or a a janitor dress all in white who mop the floor of his downtown offic in his spare time i wa abl to appreci the messag that were deliv in this movi jim carrey s movi display this fantast evolut that tie them all togeth and make the newer one look even better just becaus you can see how far he s come if you compar bruce almighti with movi like ace ventura both of which i love by the way or a lot of what he did befor he got into film it s amaz how far he s come he ha move from cheesi tv comedi to cheesi comed film to comedi that are truli intellig and meaning like this film a well a other like the truman show man on the moon and the majest easili one of his greatest film ever jim carrey ha unmistak move from the cheesi comedi of his past to becom one of the most import comic actor work today jennif aniston also onc again provid an excel addit to the movi a she did in the side split offic space a bruce s girlfriend who becom increas exasper by bruce s grow stress about his life a well a his neglig to ask her to marri him there is definit some low brow comedi in the film that doesn t realli fit with the import of the film s mean or the qualiti of the deliveri such a the dog read the newspap on the toilet and the whole monkey scene but it wa definit pretti nice to see ace ventura s friend spike make a cameo appear a stephen king veri well know it s alway nice to see familiar charact it s almost like see famili again bruce is endow with the power of god for a given period of time so that he can understand life a bit better and he say a lot about himself when he use the power onli for his own purpos rather than to help all of the peopl who pray to him the thing i love about this is that like i said befor religion is absent from my life but i wa abl to watch this and learn a lot about myself a well by think about what kind of thing i would have done had i been endow with such power the movi allow u to learn vicari this way which empow the messag even more the scene that involv the news station are easili the funniest in the entir film such a the scene when bruce lose his temper about the anchor posit the jimmi hoffa scene who wa conveni buri with an origin birth certif and a complet set of dental record the scene where bruce s rival colleagu is made to go nut on camera and my favorit the one at the begin and the end involv the local bakeri s cook the movi ha plenti of time for carrey to deliv some excel joke such a when he say to god who reveal that he s the janitor the proprietor the electrician etc that his christma parti must be real bash and to be care about drink becaus on of him might need a ride home i also love the end when he say that behind everi great man is a woman roll her eye a littl too true and a gallagh would add behind everi great man is also an amaz mother in law bruce almighti is one of the more memor comedi to have come out for quit a while and is probabl the onli direct religi that i can rememb see that i am anxious to buy on dvd to add to my person collect it is a comedi written and perform in good tast but with enough relat low brow humor to keep the kid entertain this is a meaning comedi for the whole famili which is becom rarer and rarer these day in a world that is about to be flog with yet anoth american pie film and anoth scari movi which are onli scari becaus of their sheer barbar idioci it s nice to see that there are still peopl make comedi worth watch don t miss this one 
 
 
 
a long a you go into this movi know that it s terribl bad act bad effect bad stori bad everyth then you ll love it this is one of my favorit goof on movi watch it a a comedi and have a dozen good laugh

i found it hard to like anyon in this film the central charact lindi and michael chamberlain whose daughter disappear dure a night out in the australian outback are not bad peopl but then sure not all or even most of the score of peopl we see throughout this movi would be bad if we knew them better but though we are a sure a the film want u to be of the guilt or innoc of the chamberlain from the start of their life s tragic disarray the film take on a more or le sociolog perspect pertain to gossip news medium crowd mob and assumpt it s not a movi about the degener societi of australia in particular it s mere an account of a true stori that happen there societi en mass is much le evolv than the individu feel ensur that we are when a warden insist upon kill all of an aborigin s dog becaus of the unverifi action of a singl wild dog when a random ruin life spin even further out of control owe to the major of magazin newspap and tv program distort the tragic truth to a level of drama that provok it consum into a frenzi there is no sign of empathi or even ani kind of look outsid of one s own unawar percept influenc left and right by the vigor hearsay and vibe of those who surround one s life the reason i appreci the film is becaus it turn the focus insid out from the victim to the mass the evid against lindi chamberlain asid suspicion wa jet fuel most by a virtu of her to the public eye she did not seem suffici distraught by the death of her babi daughter whi wa she abl to keep her cool even a sort of aloof let alon hold her head up for tv and the press how much of the downward spiral could ve been prevent had she behav more to the public s like in the medium meryl streep one of if not the greatest actress work today may not give a perform that particular stand out and frank neither doe ani other actor or depart of film make but she and the screenwrit do understand lindi what is infuri is that it s not that difficult appar she wa not natur prone to show emot in public in ani case whether or not she is approach a a lovabl charact in the immedi sen we are natur prone to sympath with her situat whether or not her perform is a immedi gratifi a sophi s choic the devil wear prada angel in america or other such work it is a triumph it is difficult enraptur an audienc when you purpos deni them insight into yourself she frustrat u becaus we don t know what she s think or feel it took me awhil to feel endear toward her but this is the movi s way of suggest the reaction of the public s attent she is marri to a pastor and they both practic a religion that is in a small minor and thus misinterpret by most initi they react to their loss a if to be reconcil themselv to god s will kick start a rumor mill generat the notion that their daughter s death wa some sort of ritual kill on their part whatev happen to the littl girl her parent were part of a margin with whom most of the medium s intak didn t immedi identifi so the first inclin wa to go after them like a pack of hungri well meryl streep and sam neill are constant on screen but the australian public play the real lead here like punctuat for each plot advanc director fred schepisi cut away from restaur to tenni court to dinner parti to saloon to offic where the public tri lindi and get carri away into their own passion project this golan globus docudrama is not particular memor the set s atmospher doesn t give a pleasur enough compens for the fact that no perform or facet of product stand out but it is veri success a an indict of the collect conscious of the public 
 
 
 
i rememb see this movi shown sever year ago on the lifetim tv network and thought it wa an interest stori sever year later i see it again and fall head over heel in love with this movi the stori behind the movi is fascin in and of itself the cast just make it that much more appeal meryl streep is definit at the top of her game in this pictur she nail mr chamberlain s manner the accent and even look she show the pain hurt surpris and anger that lindi had to endur and in the process it s hard to rememb that it isn t lindi in my opinion this perform of meryl s wa better than her oscar win turn in sophi s choic and should have garner her her third oscar sam neill is perfect a michael chamberlain and for some surpris reason wasn t recogn by the academi with at least a nomin in all this movi onli receiv one oscar nod streep s for best actress howev it did receiv sever australian oscar and nomin definit a top rate movi it tell a great stori and you get great perform from the entir cast 
 
 
 
meryl streep is such a genius well at least a an actress i know she s been made fun of for do a lot of role with accent but she nail the accent everi time her perform a lindi chamberlain wa inspir mr chamberlain a portray here wa not particular likabl nor all that smart but that just make streep s work all the more remark i think she is worth all or so of her oscar nomin about the film well there were a coupl of interest thing i don t know much about australia but the theme of religi bigotri among the general public play a big part in the stori i had larg miss this when i first saw the film some year ago but it came through loud and clear yesterday and it seem the australian press is just a accomplish at miseri induc pursuit and overkil a their american colleagu a pretti good film a bit differ grade b
 
 
 
this movi wa nomin for best pictur but lost out to casablanca but paul luka beat out humphrey bogart for best actor i don t see whi lucil watson wa nomin for best support actor i just don t think she did a veri good job bett davi and paul luka and their three kid are leav mexico and come into the unit state in the first scene of the movi they are go by train to davi s relat hous davi and luka were in the underground to stop the nazi so they are veri tire and need rest but when they arriv home their is a nazi live there and their s not much either can do about it it turn out the nazi onli care about money and is will to make a deal with luka their is more to the plot but you can find that out for yourself 
 
 
 
this is a docudrama stori on the lindi chamberlain case and a look at it s impact on australian societi it especi look at the problem of innuendo gossip and expect when deal with real life drama one issu the stori deal with is the way it is expect peopl will all give the same emot respons to similar situat not everyon goe into wild melodramat hyster to everi major crisi just becaus the charact in the movi and on tv act in a certain way is no reason to expect real peopl to do so this is especi apt for journalist and news editor who appear to be look for the the big sob scene that will pull the rate it s an issu that ha to be constant address the lead play the charact with depth person and sensit and they are abli support by a larg cast all play base on fact individu some viewer may be surpris to learn that mani of the support cast in this stori are peopl better known in australia a comic actor it re enforc my idea that comic actor make some of the best support in drama becaus with comedi they know how to establish quick impress of individu spoiler warn i have to say someth veri person here in that i am actual an ex adventist who wa a practic member in australia at the time this incid occur so i have a slight differ impress of the stori than most i think it is handl with amaz creativ and person and emot heart i think the best scene is the one where the coupl are hound by the new chopper it captur the theme of the stori brilliant i onc heard fred schepsi say in an interview that he told the actor to play the best case for their charact they could while this is especi apt for this stori i think it is also a general principl that should appli to all act a well 
 
 
 
onc you pick your jaw up from off the floor from the realize that they somehow manag to put this thing togeth so fast that it wa releas the same year the case end you ll find that it s not half bad the plot is engag and interest and the pace is fast with this cover mani situat and thus often jump swift on to the next one after a line or two ha been spoken where this realli stand out is the act the perform are excel neill and streep are both impecc it s also cool to hear so much australian spoken in a hollywood film and even those who don t come natur to it at least attempt an accent the cinematographi and edit are nice enough but they don t realli go beyond the standard stuff this movi s stori is compel and the fact that it is authent just make it all the more chill while i have not read the novel or heard of what happen outsid of this pictur i understand that it is quit close to the truth there is some moder to strong languag and disturb content in this it is at time a downright great courtroom drama i recommend this to ani fellow fan of such 
 
 
 
meryl streep is excel in her nuanc and stoic perform a the infam lindi chamberlain who wa accus and tri for alleg kill her own babi azaria chamberlain and use her alibi of raven dingo a her defens base on the book evil angel and titl so in it australian releas a cri in the dark is an ugli film to watch it present a scenario that s all too real for u in america the witch hunt against a person deem an easi target lindi chamberlain wa this woman be someon who spoke her mind someon who didn t play the sympathi card and someon who wa just tough enough to move on with her life despit her horrif ordeal she wa label a suspect and hate beyond comprehens even when it wa clear she didn t kill her own child the medium began a tighten noos and a progress invas of privaci that soon had the entir nation glu to their set a they eviscer this famili piec by piec and through it all lindi remain a stoic a ever even when her husband michael wa fall apart this stanc of cours is the power of strength a unsympathet a it may look like and peopl happen to react strong to that they want to see a distress mother cri and weep and occasion faint at everi turn not sit there and look blank peopl don t understand that not everyon griev the same way and when someon decid to stand strong they begin specul meryl streep embodi this taint woman to the hilt and in do so creat a cold but not unfeel woman one that stood by her convict even if they cost her liberti becaus of her sam neill is allow to have his charact slowli dissolv into despair someon ha to or the chamberlain would be too detach and no one want to see that except the monster that ha at the time of this write becom the news medium they ll alway eat train wreck up and feed the mangl manur to the uninform public 
 
 
 
spoiler follow i pick up the book evil angel when it first came out know noth of the case just to give the press and the austrialian peopl a break here i wa quit far into it befor i began to question the chamberlain s guilt the author obvious intend the reader to understand whi the public jump to the conclus they did john bryson told the stori just a it wa present to the juror and pick up by the press of the arteri spray the actelon plate dr jame cameron s certainti that the collar wa cut with scissor that a babi could not be taken whole from her cloth with the button still done up bloodi hand print etc all quit convinc after all these were expert in their field who were testifi with no appar reason to lie and the fact that the evid wa complet wrong wasn t appar to me at all it wa also high technic evid difficult for a layman to understand to this point beyond some hearsay testimoni in the trial hard anyon had ever heard of a dingo attack a human peopl didn t believ it wa possibl the public wa suspici of the seventh day adventist whose origin made them appear to be a cult and all sort of wild belief about them contribut to the appear of guilt were it not for dedic selfless lawyer who work relentless to investig and counter the trial testimoni find azaria s cloth later would not have been enough to get lindi out of jail the book shook me for that reason and i ve been reluct to come to a conclus about anyon s guilt ever sinc except oj of cours i wa thrill that a movi wa go to be made about the case and don t think it could have been done better i ve alway like sam who i could identifi with complet and meryl wa perfect a alway beauti photographi haunt music i think it s not onli a veri good but a veri import movi too bad it didn t receiv more public at the time it wa releas

this wa usual produc alexand korda s advic on set to mani of his underl the film is credit with three director but in truth alex zoltan korda and william cameron menzi help out push it to six for john kobal s book the top movi his survey of film critic saw the thief of bagdad reach th place a closer examin reveal onli jose lui guarner john russel taylor and kobal himself actual vote for the pictur but their high place were enough to take it to near the half way mark the outbreak of the second world war saw the movi s product shift around england and america eventu see complet in and win three technic oscar like citizen kane it is in some way perhap a film you might admir rather than love the special effect outstand for the time are still reason and actual hold up if you squint but it s not so much their effect a the audac of the invent among them is an amus hors construct out of a kit model which when a key is insert up it s rear end begin to fli there s also a killer toy of the six arm goddess kali perhap quit obvious a singl woman with two woman sit behind her and a quit horrif look giant spider also impress is the climax with it wonder fli carpet but most memor ha to be rex ingram appear a in a superb moment of cinemat conceit a djinn geni near a thousand foot tall ingram portray the geni a quit a menac creatur and add an element of danger to the proceed and look out for the moment where he s trick back into his bottl john justin doe well a the arab king who for some strang reason ha an english accent and a stiff upper lip sabu the astonish muscl year old is near namesak abu a likeabl cocki thief after they cross path with the evil jaffer conrad veidt justin find himself blind and abu is turn into a dog when it seem the rest of the film will be told in flashback through the blind ahm s justin s perspect we find that halfway through the movi we catch up to the present and the adventur continu in truth the second half is someway the better be full of greater incid and more fantast in natur three small song pepper the piec though a the film last for minut this feel more like mild flavour rather than a real ingredi i wouldn t classifi this a a music it s all great fun justin and june duprez are the love interest for the mum and dad veidt is the boo hiss villain and abu is the youth irrepress robber it may take a while to get into the somewhat date mindset and overblown melodrama of s english movi but onc you ve sat through the first half an hour or so this film realli draw you in quit commend 
 
 
 
although time ha reveal how some of the effect were done this stori of love and adventur still is special if you ve never seen this film befor you ll be shock at how much ha been stolen by later film maker i wa watch this with a friend who wa amaz at how much disney s aladdin crib from the film they love the movi and enjoy that it wa such a touchston for so mani other film and film maker i ve given the film an out of instead of a out of ten which is where a good portion of this film dwell becaus in the final minut the film fall apart in the pace everyth is rush a if they ha to sudden get to the end from the point from the departur of the djinn to the end it appear to be more sketch then finish paint it doesn t kill the film but it doe weaken it still it requir view for anyon who love a good fairi tale or even a great movi 
 
 
 
i have seen this film sever time and watch it today on tcm sole becaus of geraldin fitzgerald she is a much underr actress and i have to admit i have had a crush on her sinc i first saw her probabl in wuther height or more year ago the real star in this movi howev is paul luka and he deserv all the accolad he got he make it clear whether we like it or not that the end justifi the mean naziism had to be stop and anyth that help do it wa good he gave his child a line about be bad and that they should not be bad but a he said earlier when convers with adult he would do this sort of thing again without hesit luka did give an excel portray of a man caught in this situat and made it clear that what he did wa a veri hard thing to do some peopl think his victim wa a nazi but i don t think so i think he wa onli after the money his nazi associ knew this and that is whi they did not have much use for him one interest point in the film and presum also in the play is the fact that muller luca is a german while the anti german hysteria of wwi wa not repeat in wwii there wa consider anti german sentiment and some german were inter similar to what happen in california with peopl of japanes ancestri it wa someth of an act of braveri for hellman to write a play about good german at this time mayb she thought they were the one who sign the nazi soviet pact after all the u and british air forc were bomb german citi and have no qualm about kill innoc civilian i think howev that the dresden bomb and firestorm happen later after watch on the rhine wa releas the titl is someth of a play on word a the watch is look west from germani in fact watch am rhein wa a german armi march song use in wwii but the nazi had their own march song that wa use a well but muller is a german and he is engag in his own wach am rhein all the other actor did an excel job here although bodo wa too much there are child like him i am surpris he did not give his father s secret away in real life he may veri well have done so 
 
 
 
when i read other comment i decid to watch this movi first cast special michael madsen and tamer karadag good enough film veri intellig and interest becaus cast have a lot of intern special european actor and actress like from turkey and russsia second stori is basic and you can guess but if you interest action good play you ll like in my opinion third final chapter is not special or interest it s regular like other action movi final i recommend to watch this movi and i hope you ll love it enjoy d

amaz movi that in theori should be bore but is deliv with subtleti and incred act that i have long despair of ever find instead of reli on clich s and over dramat moment the plot unfold through a seri of incred realist moment the lead charact are not perfect and so relat to them a peopl you could know is easi the movi is not tri to pull laugh or push an ideal onto the audienc but simpli show u the possibl of true love in ani circumst i am now restless wait for the weekend so i can see the sequel a move thought provok funni look at love that i think should be an absolut romant classic up there with casablanca and breakfast at tiffani s will soften even the hardiest heart 
 
 
 
i m not usual a fan of strict romant movi but heard this wa good i wa stun easili the most romant thing i ve ever seen in my life stun brilliant sweet funni and full of heart the chemistri is flawless a is the write and direct ethan hawk and juli delphi are so natur and sweet togeth you realli think they re a coupl the movi grab you right away and doesn t let go you can t look away nor can you stop listen to them even the littl moment just melt your heart this ha jump into the rank of one of my favourit ever a masterpiec 
 
 
 
i m not even sure what to say about this film it s one of onli a hand of movi ever made that i would consid romant to tri to talk plot or perform or technic detail about this film would be in the word of frank zappa like danc about architectur it absolut hit the nail right on the head in the way it captur those fleet moment in life that move u and then run away from u never to be experienc again this seem like the movi the charact version of charli kaufman in the movi adapt want to write the end is left open and ambigu no happi end here just mysteri no profound life lesson just a coupl of horni and intellig kid explor the abil to feel the most irrat and unrealist of feel romant love out of watch it with your special ladi and recommend it to a stranger 
 
 
 
i must admit that at the begin i wa sort of retic about watch this movi i thought it wa this stupid littl romant film about a french woman who meet in the train an american and decid to visit vienna with him i wa not actual enchant about this kind of script sinc it continu to make me believ that it is just a movi still i watch it and i wa amaz befor sunris is one of the few film who dare to talk in a rather philosoph way wonder about the fact that in the moment of our birth we are sentenc to death or that it is a middl idea that fact that a coupl should rest togeth for etern or that we human can afford sometim to live in fairi tale the end wa wonder chosen we do not know if they will meet again in six month at six o clock in vienna s station in our optim we sincer hope so the actor act in a veri good manner so that i began to believ that i myself could live a love stori just like this 
 
 
 
the most amaz combin of love and psych of two young peopl present in the most sublim manner and definit touch your heart a rare combin where the sequel surpass the prequel in both storytel and intens of emot the movi re affirm your faith in love and pain of separ the joy of see your most belov is unparallel and anyth can be sacrif ethan and juli have essay etern charact with such simplic that give the movi a sheer joy and love to watch a must see movi for all the peopl who believ in true love by far the most romant at least one of them movi of all time 
 
 
 
my watch came a littl too late but am glad i watch both this and the sequel togeth which make me compliment the maker of this flick for give such a pure and basic treatment to the idea of romantic and veri margin separ it from the idea of relationship a a lot ha been written about the movi alreadi it would just be appropri to highlight few portion of the movi which i person love i think the point where jess and celin make phoni phone call to their respect friend wa a veri shrewd way of tell each other what they had meant to each other through a journey not even extend hr the curio of two peopl who both think the other ha made an infal impact on the other ha been veri smart dealt with on the plot front make a romant stori work on pure convers is not an easi job to accomplish i believ in romant flick of such flavor the charact are not clear design even in the writer s and director s mind what the actor bring out is what becom of them right or wrong even the idea bearer would find it difficult to justifi to becom the charact the life the actor give ha to go beyond instruct and the stori here both the actor do just the right job kudo and befor sunset is anoth feather which make this one even more beauti 
 
 
 
i manag to catch a late night doubl featur last night of befor sunris and befor sunset and saw both film in a row without realli have the chanc to catch my breath in between or ponder on the mean of each film separ after sleep it over i have to say that i larg prefer the former over the latter and i shall explain whi befor sunris introduc u with then young actor ethan hawk realiti bite dead poet societi onli at the time of the film s releas and juli delpi the three color trilog then although look much younger he is a promiscu american writer tour europ after break up with his girlfriend she is a young french student on her way home to pari they meet on the budapest vienna train and spontan decid to get off the train togeth the two deepli spiritu and intellectu individu than spend a whole night togeth walk the beauti captur street of vienna exchang ideal and thought and gradual fall on love the film ha s written all over it back then technolog wa leap rapid the new millennium with all it s hope and dream wa wait just around the corner and young adult like the one depict in the film were fill with love of life and passion for the futur the charact of jess hawk and celin delpi with all their flaw and inconsist celin s accent if by mistak or on purpos wa half american half french and it swing from one spectrum to the other break the charact s credibl were a mirror of the time watch the naiv coupl swallow life with such mean and excit act all clich d and romant yet manag to have the audienc fall for them a well is what realli made this movi work for me the fact that the director doesn t let you know if their relationship continu after the film or not make it all even more worth while all in all sunris is a dreami stroll through the urban landscap of vienna a well told classic romant rendezv and a film i will definit return to for further insight sometim in the futur 
 
 
 
this is a slow move stori no action no crazi suspens no abrupt surpris if you cannot stand to see a movi about two peopl just talk and walk about a stori that develop slowli till the veri end and about lovey dovey romanc don t wast your time and money on the other hand if you re into dialog master stori tell thought provok idea and find true love in the fabric of life then this is your movi i recommend you watch this movi when you are most alert though becaus the pace the music and the overal tone of the movi can put you in a woolgath mood it s truli fantast i realli mean that ethan hawk and juli delpi are annoy with their manner at time but thank the chemistri between the two make the act veri natur warm and tender they act and feel each other out from the veri begin make you feel a an intrud in their convers there are excel commentari on mani subject that will provok thought and convers between you and your partner i thought it wa too deep and too diver for such young charact but i may be underestim their intellig still it did not ruin the movi the overal stori is veri simpl which i think give the movi it s charm and ultim it s power bottom line the movi s flow is slow the dialog is fascin the stori build gentl systemat and substant the build up to the final is satisfi and in the end reward 
 
 
 
after a chanc encount on the train a young coupl spend a singl night stroll the street of vienna discus life and love the primari reason to see befor sunris is to watch a young juli delpi deliv her line a celin this sexi braini soul brown eye blond is sort of a cross between brigitt bardot and joni mitchel a they were in their mid twenti risk overstat celin is practic the ideal woman unusu beauti and veri feminin while be natur unpretenti introspect and selfless love we can easili forgiv that she is a bit eccentr and talk a blue streak for her sincer intellig remark are occasion penetr further her vari express are noth short of captiv and she speak english with a french accent that is veri endear if there is a fli in the ointment of this good movi it would have to be her unkempt and dishevel costar ethan hawk a jessi come off like a vagu appeal slob sort of a maynard g kreb of the nineti attempt to appear detach and nonchal he sort of drag himself through certain shot his pant fit poor his tee shirt is come untuck his wavi dark hair his most attract featur need a good wash and someon realli should have show him how to proper trim his youth goate nevertheless he is suppos to repres an unwash youth on a two week train ride around europ so the look he ha cultiv is probabl pretti genuin his oft cynic observ and wri sen of humor seem to impress the unapologet romant celin although she is occasion disturb by the extent of his alien when he final admit to her that he is utter sick of himself and like be near her becaus he feel like a differ person in her presenc we know he is get somewher after blow their collect fund on a seri of cafe bar and silli diver they agre that becaus they may never see one anoth again they should make the most of it jess bum a bottl of red wine off a sentiment bartend so that he and his newfound ladi love may repair to a local park in the middl of the night to lie on the grass look up at the moon and the star and watch the sun come up given his boundless luck in the romanc depart it is especi irksom when jessi a the veri definit of a naiv jerk foolish allow this wonder young ladi to slip from his grasp he content himself with a half bake plan quick devi at the railroad station when he bid her adieu to reunit at the same spot in half a year when the appoint time come you just know this beauti and unusu girl will be involv with anoth perhap even marri and pregnant for whatev reason she probabl won t show while jess who end up work at target or if he s lucki the local librari will go back to vienna desper to see her again onli to wind up alon despit what for me wa a veri discourag conclus befor sunris is a beauti movi i high recommend both it and the sequel befor sunset 
 
 
 
this movi is intellig that is more than most other movi it transcend the least common denomin stupid peopl will probabl not appreci it the stori also reli heavili on dialogu it ha some parallel to lost in translat although befor sunris is much brighter somehow le abstract and simpli a lot better the script the charact and even the slight surreal atmospher feel total realist the actor play absolut brilliant rare have i seen a movi where the script and the act ha melt this perfect togeth the dialogu move into veri person issu with the risk of becom a littl over the top it doe howev stay on the right side almost all the time although i found a few moment a littl awkward and embarrass balanc on this fine line demand outrag talent actor sometim it yield great result and overal this movi is simpli stupend onli veri veri rare is love in film depict in a way that i find trustworthi and realist everi time that is achiev the result is fantast i think the stun and appar timeless beauti of the femal lead actress help quit a bit in this respect she still look stun in this film year after this is simpli a gem of a movi that you can t miss one of the best movi i have seen from the s 
 
 
 
richard linklat s beauti direct mixtur of youth romanc and pari travelogu is one of the s best think person s romant movi juli delpi turn in one of the decad s most engag perform a the parisian lass who spend a day with stranger on a train ethan hawk the dialogu and there is oodl of it is sometim meander and over precious but this portrait of two young wannab lover make a romant intellectu and spiritu connect to one anoth is full of wonder amus touch and insight moment 
 
 
 
if you are a travel if there is a fire burn into your heart if you d call home everi place on earth but none of them can give you enough if you are alway look for the next thing and if you believ the other part of your soul is somewher out there see this movi and you ll find out a littl but wonder piec of life sit next to you 
 
 
 
i had never heard of this film befor a coupl of week ago but it concept interest me when i heard it an american man meet a european woman on his last night in europ and they spend the night togeth talk it spark my interest but i never expect it to be this great befor sunris is a masterpiec and it s also one of the most romant film on record to my surpris it complet lack the cynic of the s it s imposs to realli talk too much about it sinc there is no real plot so to speak although there are plenti of thorough interest thing you could talk about it is sort of like my dinner with andr where there is a convers but it s not just the convers that matter but let me just say see it see it 
 
 
 
mani of the critic on this thread seem to pick a comparison of this film with the mortal storm or casablanca everyon is entitl to compar film they choos but the similar of the mortal storm and watch on the rhine are clear the problem of refuge threaten by the nazi juggernaut while the main compar point brought out with casablanca is the seem unjust treatment of humphrey bogart in by the academi of motion pictur art and scienc becaus they chose paul luka instead for the best actor oscar it doe not strike me a total wrong luka had a good career in film both here and in england he is the villain in the ladi vanish and this perform wa his best one bogart had more great perform in him than rick blain for instanc he wa ignor for sam spade in the maltes falcon and roy earl in high sierra two year earlier both of which were first rate perform and he would not get an oscar for his greatest perform a fred c dobb in the treasur of sierra madr the writer murder suspect in in a lone place and captain philip franci queeg in the cain mutini afterward he got it for charley in the african queen i think that bogi should have got it for the role of dobb but it did not happen but luka wa lucki he got it on the defin perform of his lesser career few can claim that to me the film to look at with watch on the rhine is base on anoth play script by hellman the search wind they both look at america s spirit of isolation in the s and s the search wind is realli look at the whole inter war period while watch on the rhine set in the year just proceed our entri into world war ii deal with a few week of time therefor it is better construct a a play and more meaning for it s impact the film ha mani good perform led by luka a the exhaust but determin anti nazi fighter courier davi a his loyal wife wise keep her charact a low key a possibl due to luka be the center of the play s activ coulouri a the selfish conniv but ultim foolish and ineffect teck lucill watson a the mother of davi and geraldin fitzgerald a coulouri wiser and sadder and fed up wife and kurt katch who deliv a devast critiqu a the local embassi s gestapo chief about coulouri and other who would deal with the nazi it ha dialog with bite in it and what it say is quit true it also ha moment of near poetri wit the scene toward the end when coulouri is left alon with luka and davi and say the new world ha left the scene to the old world hellman could write veri well at time given the strength of the film script and perform i would rate this film high among world war ii film

befor sunris is romanc for the slacker generat richard linklat s romant drama is an offbeat tell of a dream come true for most peopl the film depict romanc in all it s glori but without ani of the pitfal that befal most coupl and in short the film is about two peopl that have a relationship that s a close to perfect a relationship will ever come to with just one problem the problem of time while most relationship wind down with time this one keep go strong throughout and time itself is the onli thing that wear out befor sunris is certain not the typic sentiment hollywood romanc which is anoth aspect that put this film leagu ahead of the pretend the stori follow two peopl jess an american and celin a french girl that meet on a train into vienna they instant connect and after tell her his aw idea for a televis show and almost get off the train jess ask celin to join him for the day in the picturesqu citi of vienna befor sunris work princip for two reason realist act and an immens script that build the charact through their thought and feel and thus allow u to get to know them a we do the peopl in real life this allow the charact to be free and it s easi to believ that these are real peopl and not just actor work from a script this also allow u to feel for the charact for who they are and not mere becaus they re the protagonist this kind of realism is hard to captur a at the end of the day we a the audienc know that they re watch a film and not observ real life but befor sunris repres one of the truest to life exhibit of realism ever to be seen on screen a truli great script cannot work on it s own and need great actor to deliv it to an extent that doe it justic and although i m not a fan of either juli depli or ethan hawk on view this film there is noth you can do but give them both respect i don t know whether they were in charact or just play themselv but when a film is this good it hard matter in a film like this it is the write that s the most import thing and contain within the script are sever observ about life most of which i person could relat to this repres what richard linklat ha achiev with this script a not onli doe it creat and build the charact but it also manag to expo what true love is along with sever other aspect of life the fact that not all the anecdot are relat to me person again repres the brillianc of write everyon is differ and so differ part of the script will appeal to differ peopl there could be certain aspect about one person that one person love and anoth hate and that s the case with the muse in this script ad to the beauti of the film is the citi of vienna the citi itself isn t realli import to the film a this is a stori that could have taken place just about anywher but it make for some love visual and the upbeat energet romanc that blossom throughout the movi is match by the beauti of the locat befor sunris is simultan beauti and captiv richard linklat ha creat someth that is rare in the world of cinema a film that captur the beauti of life without ever go over the top or be over sentiment befor sunris is what it is and what it is is pure cinemat brillianc

mario s first foray into the world of dimens is incred miyamoto s masterpiec wa reason enough to buy a nintendo when it wa releas in and it still hold all of it s charm today this game is an instant classic that set the standard for d adventur platform game 
 
 
 
this movi had an interest cast it mat not have had an a list cast but the actor that were in this film did a good job im glad we have b grade movi like this one the stori is basic the actor are basic and so is the way they execut it you don t need a million dollar budget to make a film just a mix of b list ordinari actor and a basic plot i like the way they had the street to themselv and that there wa no one el around and also what i though wa interest is that they didn t close down a caf to set there gear and that they did it all from a polic station arnold vosloo and michael madsen did a great job at portray there role in the hostag situat this wa a great film and i hope to see more like it in the near futur 
 
 
 
although super mario isn t like the rest of the game in the seri it is still a classic and is everi bit a good a the old game game with this much replay valu are few and far between plus this game ha so much varieti there are level each with sever differ task you can do and mani other hidden task the game isn t veri challeng but it lack of challeng doesn t take away from the game at all onc you beat it you ll want to era your game and start again and it just a much fun the second time or third time or two hundredth time a must own for ani nintendo owner and is a reason in itself to own a nintendo 
 
 
 
one of the funnest mario s i ve ever play the level are creativ there are fluid control and good graphic for it time there s also a multitud of crazi bos and enemi to fight sometim the level get frustrat and if you leav out some of the hard level and still need to get more accomplish to fight a bos it can be annoy anoth complaint is the camera angl though it work fair well most of the time it can be a pain in certain situat if your a big time mario fan this one for you even if your not a huge fan of him i d still recommend this one it a big game and get what you need can take a while but it s veri satisfi good for play in short burst of time it will almost certain hold your interest it sure doe hold mine 
 
 
 
this game is amaz realli you should get it if you don t have it although it is ancient now it wa amaz when it came out i believ that this game will alway be a classic it s just a good a super mario world or so when i wa young my friend and i would sit and play this game for hour tri to beat it which we eventu did it s not near a advanc a super mario galaxi but if you are a fellow mario fan it is essenti it s fun entertain and challeng everyth you could want out of a fantasi game except for good graphic well it did come out in rock on eva mario luigi and yoshi nintendo is the best 
 
 
 
if you have ani clue about jane austen s product you ll now that she repeat the same in each of her novel marriag marriag and marriag in my opinion all the movi made from her novel are a bit bore but i like austen s charact becaus they all have a certain person and typic say they like to repeat a also in emma the thing that make emma good is gwyneth paltrow she s veri good in her lead role also the fact that each one of the charact in the movi don t seem to be abl to think anyth but how to get a good partner and soon marri make the movi hilari 
 
 
 
a slight charm littl movi to be sure but a superbl craft one gwyneth paltrow shine in this earli showcas for her british accent and the cast assembl around her all lap up the dialogu this came out around the time of sen and sensibl and i m sure i don t know whi that one garner all the oscar attent emma is jane austen s most access and least stuffi stori told well 
 
 
 
lavish product valu and solid perform in this straightforward adapt of jane austen s satir classic about the marriag game within and between the class in provinci th centuri england northam and paltrow are a salutori mixtur a friend who must pas through jealousi and lie to discov that they love each other good humor is a sustain virtu which goe a long way toward explain the access of the age sourc materi which ha been tone down a bit in it harsh sceptic i like the look of the film and how shot were set up and i thought it didn t reli too much on success of head shot like most other film of the s and s do veri good result 
 
 
 
wrap in gorgeous english countri background emma is a delici confect to be relish for dreami getaway emma gwyneth paltrow is a grace intellig young woman who ha just marri off her gover and confid to a marriag which emma take the credit in matchmak eager to use her talent in arrang thing for the peopl around her she decid to match the vicar mr elton alan cum with her pretti young friend harriet toni collett the result is a seri of mix signal and mistaken interpret that end up sort themselv out with emma learn that she did not have a much control over event a she thought the film is full of jane austen s witti and wri character gwyneth paltrow is at her best portray this maiden of a restrain polit societi with wit and ea her grow romanc with the unparallel mr knightley jeremi northam is the heart of this film mr knightley is one of the greatest romant lead men in film he is incred handsom in a modest relax way that is irresist he is certain well match to gwyneth paltrow their charm friendship that began when he wa and she wa an infant ha blossom a he a famili friend match wit with her in an older brother fashion that grow into someth more with a wri look or underst jab at emma northam s knightley is a delight to watch other wonder character includ the comic juliet stevenson greta scacchi ewan mcgregor polli walker and the talkat spinster miss bate who is veri funni seem shorter and more flow than most jane austin adapt emma ha comic rhythm that promis true enjoy 
 
 
 
this is a good adapt of austen s novel good but not brilliant the cinematographi is invent cross at time the border to gimmickri but it certain avoid the trap of make this look like a bore tv soap in costum given that the entir stori is dialogu driven the act is compet m paltrow is aloof a her charact requir but the requir distanc from the other charact is accompani by a much le appropri detach from her own action in other word she doe not seem to care enough of the result of her match make endeavour some of the support cast is guilti of over act veri much in the style that is appreci on stage but out of place in motion pictur person i had problem accept alan cum a mr elton to no fault of his own except for have left such an impress a a gay trolley dolli in the high life that it is now difficult to accept him play ani serious part act honour go to toni collett who manag to radiat warmth and jeremi northam who pitch his charact at just the right level

yes i m go with the on this and here s whi in the last few year i have watch quit a few comedi and onli left with a few mild laugh and a coupl video rental late fee becaus the movi were that easi to forget then i stumbl upon noth look interest wasn t expect much though i wa wrong this wa probabl one of the funniest movi i have ever had the chanc to watch dave and andrew make a great comed pair and the humor wa catchi enough to rememb but not over complex to the point of miss the joke i don t want to remark on ani of the actual scene becaus i do feel this is a movi worth see for onc with more and more pointless concept come into movi you know like killer militari jet and fresh remak that are ruin old classic this movi will make you happi to say it s ok to laugh at noth 
 
 
 
this is a good movi but it is not recommend if you don t like intellig movi it s about two guy that wish that the world would go away and that s exact what they get the act is great the end wa not predict and it actual had a good stori unlik most movi these day peopl complain about the movi be too simpl or too bore i think they should just stick to movi like the toxic aveng i actual like b movi or the grim adventur of billi and mandi one note if you notic this this ha exact the same actor from cube except four actor make it two note wait after the credit trust me on this one enjoy the movi 
 
 
 
i thought this wa an awesom movi the theme song is sweet anyway the onli thing that somewhat bother me wa in the begin when everyth should have been normal it wa veri weird and unrealist the big cabl compani is main what i m talk about apart from that the movi wa veri creativ i think that all the act wa well done the actor act out their charact person perfect everyth fit togeth well it realli is a shame that their isn t a soundtrack that would have been great becaus this is a canadian film and becaus it is one of my favorit i give this movi a out of 
 
 
 
tweak a littl bit noth could be a child s film it s a veri clever concept touch upon some interest metaphys theme and goe against pretti much everi hollywood convent you can think of what goe against everyth more than liter noth noth is the stori of two friend who wish the world away when everyth goe wrong with their live all that s left is what they don t hate and a big empti white space it s hard to focus a stori on just two actor for the major of your film especi without ani cut to anyth go on outsid the plot it focus on pretti much one subject but that s prime vincenzo natali territori if you ve seen cube you know alreadi that he tend to like that type of situat the noth in this movi is appar infinit space but natali somehow manag to make it somewhat claustrophob if onli becaus there s liter noth el and nowher el to go the actor sell it although you can tell these guy are friend anyway two actor from cube return here worth and kazan but are entir differ charact they chang throughout the stori and while they re not the strongest actor in the world they re at least believ the reason i say this could be a child s film under the right tweak is becaus asid from a few f bomb and a somewhat unnecessari bloodi dream sequenc the whimsic and often silli feel of this movi could veri much be digest easili by kid so i find it an odd choic that the writer decid to add some crass languag and a small amount of gore especi consid there isn t veri much of it this could ve gotten a pg rate easili had they simpli cut a few thing out and chang a littl dialogu there is veri littl objection about this film but just enough to keep parent from want their kid to see it i onli say that s a shame becaus not becaus i support censorship but becaus that may have been the onli thing prevent this movi from have wider exposur at ani rate this is a reason entertain film albeit with a few drag out scene but for liter be about noth and focus entir on two charact and their interact with absolut noth they do a surpris good job for an independ film 
 
 
 
a light heart comedi noth show u a world that we sometim wish to escap to a world of noth anyth you don t like be it a stack of bill a bad memori or even hunger can disappear at your wish they approach this movi veri well and with an enjoy star duo there were onli a few thing i didn t like about noth and they weren t even part of the main movi first the post credit scene and yes there is one good for a chuckl but what were they tri to accomplish with that i wa confus and eager to see a return to someth after a whole movi of noth instead we just hear a random assort of nois and they scream it tri to set up a sequel in my opinion and wasn t realli necessari nor wa it funni after the turtl crawl out of frame second the trailer i saw the trailer on the dvd and like other have alreadi said this it promot a horror movi that never came oh well poor market i guess if you see this at your movi rental store take a look becaus noth is a great movi to watch if you have a big screen though you might want to wear shade 
 
 
 
well cube vincenzo s first movi wa one of the most interest and tricki idea that i ve ever seen when talk about movi they had just one sceneri a bunch of actor and a plot so what made it so special were all the effect direct great dialog and a bizarr condit that charact had to deal like rat in a labyrinth his second movi cypher wa all about it stori but it wasn t so good a cube but here are the charact be test like rat again noth is someth veri interest and get vincenzo come back to his cube day lock the charact onc again in a veri differ space with no time onc more play with the charact like play with rat in an experi room but instead of a thriller sci fi even some of the promot teaser and trailer erron seem like that noth is a loo and light comedi that for sure can be call a modern satir about our societi and also about the intoler world we re live onc again vicenzo amaz u with a great idea into a so small kind of thing actor and a blind white scenario that s all you got most part of time and you don t need more than that while cube is a claustrophob experi and cypher confus noth is complet the opposit but at the same time also desper this movi prove onc again that a smart idea mean much more than just a millionair budget of cours that the movi fail sometim but it prime idea mean a lot and offset ani flaw there s noth more to be said about this movi becaus everyth is a brilliant surpris and a total differ experi that i had in movi sinc cube 
 
 
 
have seen cube i ve been a fan of vincenzo natali s work natali seem to have this inept abil to take a storylin and hard wring it our like a wet towel for all the storylin he can muster instead he let the stori themselv unfold in natur way so much in fact that you may in fact believ there is this cube were peopl tri to escap or in the case of noth a larg empti expans where there is noth the advert had me hook instant it seem so simpl take two charact who no one like and send them to a world where there is noth natali doe this so simpli that you forget the logic that a place where there is noth cannot exist in fact the world of noth becom someth of an ironi within the film there s noth there but also someth there it might be a good time to point out that the trailer is high mislead i wa fortun enough to actual understand that the film lean to a more comed side than the trailer otherwis told so therefor upon watch the film i laugh everi now and again wherea someon who the advert mislead may find themselv utter confus if i may take a minut to give the film some prais where the film excel on is the concept it is a genius concept to have a world of noth and to put two charact there not two brilliant mind charact who will philosophis and work out their surround but two idiot who have absolut no clue a to where the hell they are anoth strong point is the film s cinematographi though at first this may not seem it where each wall north earth south west up and down is just a white plane a percept of depth becom faulti it is hard to determin where thing are place in the mi en scene the cinematographi ha mani moment where this actual happen but for the most part the camera is place so that two charact or an object and a charact are place in the foreground and background allow a sen of depth to be realis howev this film doe lack in certain area the film is relat short but even so after a while the novelti of this world of noth becom rather dull and you wish to find some form of resolut within the plot we can also argu that the act is onc again question these two charact are in a sen unlik therefor we feel no sympathi at ani point for these charact howev on a flip side of that the chemistri and friendship between the two charact seem real enough but there is someth lack even so i do rank this a a thorough enjoy film do not let the trailer fool you into think this is anoth scienc fiction horror film it is much more of a comedi than that it is inde worth watch though pure for the concept itself 
 
 
 
i just saw this at the toronto film festiv and i hope it get wide releas becaus i want to see it again it is a charact driven film and andrew and david are more than up to the task ani discus of the plot might be consid spoiler so i ll just say that the storylin is clever the act is superb and the effect are amaz well film and well pace too one of the best film i have seen in age and veri refresh in this summer of dreari movi it had the audienc laugh the whole time see it if you can i particular like the candi bar candi bar scene 
 
 
 
if you want mindless action hot chick and a post apocalypt view of seattl then this is the show for you the concept of dark angel isn t anyth new in fact there s controversi over whether jame cameron stole the idea from a book but i spend the entir hour watch it everi tuesday from start to finish jessica alba is smoke and max friend origin cindi kendra are just a hot the fight scene are get better but the dialogu between origin cindi and max need to be a littl bit better the slang sound forc and it sound like someon live in the suburb wrote it in my opinion dark angel is a great guilti pleasur fill with everyth an action fan could ask for but if you re look for hard hit award win drama go watch the west wing or someth 
 
 
 
the premis of this movi ha been tickl my imagin for quit some time now we ve all heard or read about it in some kind of con text what would you do if you were all alon in the world what would you do if the entir world sudden disappear in front of your eye in fact the last part is actual what happen to dave and andrew two room mate live in a run down hous in the middl of a freeway system andrew is a nervous wreck to say the least and dave is consid be one of the biggest loser of societi that alon is the main reason to whi these two guy get so well along becaus they simpli onli have each other to turn to when comfort is need just until straight from the begin of the film lot and lot of problem happen to them both of them get involv with crime andrew suffer from paranoia and simpli doesn t dare go out of the hous dave is unsuccess at his job and his colleagu don t treat him veri well and with the respect he deserv the amount of problem they face keep increas until that one day where they may have to face the inevit and deal with it this is just too much for them and they wish that everyth would just go away and of cours that is exact what happen the rest of the stori place dave and andrew in this world of nothing at first they are surpris and have problem understand and deal with the featur of this crazi environ but later on they find out that they can do just about everyth they want becaus it seem a if they are the onli one still left noth featur an incred small cast in fact besid the first coupl of shot from the film we onli see dave david hewlett and andrew andrew miller in the entir film it is clear that in order to pull this off the cast ha to be more than up for the task becaus in a world where noth exist there is noth that can distract the viewer in ani way vincenzo ha decid to use a reason amount of close up head shot to make it more interest and it actual work quit well director of photographi derek roger also ha a nice way of tea the audienc by withhold visual inform especi at time where a charact see someth and react to it but we don t see it right away obvious this can t be an event driven film and it s not much of the action happen outsid their hous when they move around in the void and that s where some of the most hilari scene take place especi in the case of when andrew discov a candi bar now one could be think how doe noth look like well it look like noth inde the entir world of noth is white white no matter in what direct you look this is the weak of this film after an hour or le it s get extrem bore to look at and there ha to be event to make sure it s more interest to look at thank god there are some for exampl at time when the two lad due to the properti of noth are abl to jump realli high a if noth is made out of tofu a andrew claim it s fun to see how they are instant abl to use noth to becom god of their own littl societi one of the best part of the film is the set product design jasna stefanov ha done a beauti job in this film the hous in which these two guy live is so unnatur fun to look at still it seem right for these two to be live in a place like this all in all the product design is with no doubt one of the most power aspect of this film at it realli make the film worth watch howev the veri best part of the film is the act both david hewlett and andrew miller realli look like the profession actor they both are the camera is on them for everi second of the film and a previous said there are just about no prop in the film they are realli on a bare stage with plenti of charact develop and some decent one liner clever dialogu at time hilari stupid it all work to that end and this realli move the movi away from the low budget area to well craft handwork let s talk a littl about the visual effect becaus they are definit worth mention noth featur digit visual effect and prosthet that equal ani modern horror film there s a rather horrifi dream sequenc in the film and although the drew have milk that scene complet it s still fun to watch one of the best visual effect in the film is at the end where andrew and dave sudden discov their power in this environ they have the abil to wish everyth away so what if they can do it the other way around and make thing appear noth is a bright and well lit movi it realli help promot the idea of them probabl be dead this is in fact one of their theori but noth is a comedi and it slowli destroy it own theori we don t know where they are or what ha happen to them we don t know if they will ever get out becaus the movi end befor we see anyth like that the end by the way is not a good a it could ve been it s rather easi to predict what is go to happen still the writer have thought up a few incid that help make it a littl more interest and in the end it s a reason satisfactori one take hollow man kill bill cube epoch and lot of other film and you have noth it realli is an amalgam of differ style still there is no other film at least that i know of noth is realli like for the peopl rememb the origin cube product commentari on it dvd may rememb that vincenzo natali talk about how he came up with the stori of cube he

my former cambridg contemporari simon heffer today a writer and journalist ha put forward the theori that just a british film maker in the eighti were often critic of what they call thatcher s britain the eal comedi were intend a satir on attle s britain the britain which had come into be after the labour victori in the general elect this theori wa presum not intend to appli to say kind heart and coronet which is if anyth a satir on the edwardian upper class or to the ladykil or the lavend hill mob both of which may contain some satir but are not polit in natur it can howev be appli to most of the other film in the seri especi passport to pimlico pimlico is or at least wa in the forti a predomin work class district of london set on the north bank of the thame about a mile from victoria station it is not quit correct to say a ha often been said that the film is about pimlico declar itself independ of britain what happen is that an ancient charter come to light prove that in the fifteenth centuri the area wa cede by king edward iv to the duchi of burgundi this mean that technic pimlico is an independ state and ha been for near five hundr year irrespect of the wish of it inhabit the govern promis to pas a special act of parliament to rectifi the anomali but until the act receiv the royal assent the area remain outsid the unit kingdom and british law do not appli becaus pimlico is not subject to british law the landlord of the local pub is free to open whatev hour he choos and local shopkeep can sell whatev they plea to whomev they plea unhind by the ration law when other trader start move into the area to sell their good in the street the british author are horrifi by what they regard a legalis black market and seal off the area to tri and forc the burgundian a the peopl of pimlico have renam themselv to surrend mani of the eal comedi have a their central theme the idea of the littl man take on the system either a an individu a happen in the man in the white suit or the lavend hill mob or a part of a larger communiti a happen in whiski galor or the titfield thunderbolt the central theme of passport is that of ordinari men and woman take on bureaucraci and govern impos regul which seem to be an increas import featur of life in the britain of the forti the film s particular target is the ration system dure the war the system had been accept by most peopl a a necessari sacrific in the fight against nazism but it becam increas polit controversi when the govern tri to retain it in peacetim it wa a major factor in the grow unpopular of the attle administr which had been elect with a larg major in and organis such a the british housew leagu were set up to campaign for the abolit of ration i cannot agre with the review who state that the main target of the film s satir were the spiv black market who play a relat minor part in the action or the housew leagu who do not appear at all the satir is veri much target at the bureaucrat who are portray either a have a rule for rule sake mental or a desir to pas the buck and avoid have to take ani action at all i suspect that if the film were to be made today it would have a differ end with pimlico remain independ a a british version of monaco or san marino inde i suspect that today this concept would probabl serv a the basi of a tv sitcom rather than a film in howev four year after the end of the war the film maker were keen stress patriot and british ident so the film end with pimlico be reabsorb into britain one of the best known line from the film is we alway were english and we alway will be english and it s just becaus we are english that we re stick up for our right to be burgundian there is a sharp contrast between the rather heartless attitud of officialdom with the common sen toler and good humour of the cockney of pimlico all of which are present a be quintessenti british characterist most of the action take place dure a summer drought and swelter heatwav but in the last scene after pimlico ha rejoin the uk the temperatur drop and it start to pour with rain global warm may have alter thing slight but for mani year part of be british wa the abil to hold the belief whatev statist might say to the contrari that britain had an abnorm wet climat the abil to make joke about that climat wa equal import there is a good perform from stanley holloway a arthur pemberton the grocer and small time local politician who becom the prime minist of free pimlico and an amus cameo from margaret rutherford a a batti histori professor in the main howev this is appropri enough for a film about a small communiti pull togeth an exampl of ensembl act with no real star perform but with everyon make a contribut to an excel film it lack the ill will and rancour of mani more recent satir film but it wit and satir are no le effect for all that it remain one of the funniest satir on bureaucraci ever made and with the possibl except of kind heart and coronet is my person favourit among the eal comedi 
 
 
 
everi time this film is on the bbc somebodi in the radio time say how it is a satir against the post war world of ration and the welfar state i do not think this is the point of the film at all the film parodi the spiv small time crimin who ran the blackmarket and the housew leagu who campaign against govern restrict but were realli a torus front organis yes of cours the film send up the polit social situat but in the end the peopl realis that they need all the control to ensur a fair societi they want to be british and muddl through rather than foreign but i don t think they go back to be exact like they were befor

it s cheesi it s creepi it s gross but that s what make it so much fun it s got over the top melodramat moment that are just plain laughabl this movi is great to make fun of rent it for a good laugh the film center around three woman newscast dure a time way befor cellphon they go to a small town to cover a festiv but they can t get a room to stay the night and that s when they meet ernest keller he s creepi in a psycho kind of way and he offer to let them stay at his home but he doesn t tell them the truth about who live there stephen furst s perform is so amaz a the unseen that he realli carri this film most of the movi is kind of dull although find out the truth of ernest s famili is kind of interest just see this cast in these scene make it worth a look barbara bach and doug barr make nice eye candi i consid the movi an old gem hard to find and worth a look 
 
 
 
the unseen is done in a style more like old hollywood mysteri than a horror show the film is somewhat slow but lot of bizarr imageri keep it the film aliv and watchabl the basic idea of young girl stalk by someth in the basement is old but good act and product make the movi worth watch the movi is notabl for it emot impact and certain not for ani explicit action or special effect i rate it an out of 
 
 
 
all the act done in the first season ha been realli amaz the first look you get of max and zach is through geneva lock and chris lazar or a i like to call them the mini the mini do the best act job that i have ever seen kid do the main actor and actress i e jessica alba michael weather etc make you forget you are watch a fiction t v show they seem to make this show come aliv all in all this is the best show i have ever watched
 
 
 
upon the first view i found this tale to be at least le annoy than other cannon movi tale after mani more i think it s one of the best some of the song are pretti bad especi the love song but two thing stand out that make the movi even the sing worthwhil one is the art direct like the other cannon movi tale this is a beauti decor period piec everi piec of cloth and jewel both of which have major part in this movi s plot look fresh and new and contrast with the plain cloth of the peasant even dure the love song i find myself studi the dress and hair of the princess wonder done the other thing is the comic time a lot of the movi is cheesi but the emperor s vaniti and his make fun of himself in the end the suspici guard the guard chase nichola and the stupid princ were all quit funni and seem to be ridicul quit on purpos and the sequenc dure the song weav o make up for the song that weren t so good

i thought i should qualifi my posit after read other review the movi is not great but it ha a lot of great element the light and scene along with the camera work are great the stori is slow and weak but entertain the act is bad but no wors than you will find on the syfi channel the music is pretti good and the gore is good it ha the great leather face in the film and is produc by bruce campbel i watch the complet movi and while most predict it wa still enjoy the woman are attract enough and the lead actor doe a good job of be brood and creepi the movi wa remark clean for a modern film and the violenc appropri for child and up there wa no sex scene i gave it out of and i think that is fair i would watch it again if i had noth better to do the gay sound angel wa the most annoy aspect of the film the devil is quit creepi 
 
 
 
 hatr of a minut is arguabl one of the better film to come out of michigan in recent year not to say that it s a brilliant film by ani mean but it s definit worth a watch hatr chronicl the sordid adventur of eric seaver play by director kallio a former abus child now grown up and start to listen to his evil side hatr is veri nice visual the shot are creativ and the light is appropori moodi and interest to look at this film actual ha an element of product valu to it unlik other recent michigan releas like dark tomorrow and biker zombi subtl dolli shot and styliz shot composit show good use of this film s budget howev hatr stumbl in the same place that so mani other local film do and that s in the stori and charact depart essenti thing just kind of happen eric seaver doesn t evolv at all basic he s alway been crazi it s just that peopl are start to notic the film just wander along it merri way with veri littl develop also the end is veri abrupt howev sinc this is a horror film sinc when do we care about plot we just want to see peopl die and hatr certain deliv a the bodi count mount peopl in the theater start cheer kill her kill em all when peopl scream back at the screen it s alway fun that s the place where hatr succeed it s fun and in the end that s all that realli matter 
 
 
 
this is a decent littl flick made in michigan about a guy that is haunt by his past with his abus stepfath gunnar hansen and ha grown up not so well adjust in fact he s absolut bonker but tri not to be too obvious he s got an entourag too his own littl demon angel that follow him around the demon never say a word but realli doesn t have to and he s max schreck creepi let s just say that the angel pretti much spin his wheel in this a eric is busi do thing that make him feel better like free peopl that he decid need it most beauti young woman this is a decent portray of mad and you re kind of on your own at some point to figur out some of what s go on but overal i watch this from start to finish veri focus on the film becaus it definit held my interest it s a littl lack in some area but noth i can realli lay my finger on a decent effort and worth see if you like serial killer flick 
 
 
 
so what constitut a real independ film in a day and age where the latest fad of mainstream hollywood is to appear rug and cut edg i m sorri to say that what the general public tend to perceiv a independ film is usual noth more than a clever market ploy which is whi we should be glad that film like hatr of a minut exist across the board this film make a point out of contradict it own templat indi horror film love it or hate it hatr isn t afraid of be what it is and in watch this film you get the real sen that kallio the director didn t just make this film to spray fake blood all over the place he s in this to tell stori good one you may find this film in the horror film section of your video store but don t be fool this stori is also about love about good peopl push over the edg and that oh so distant light at the end of the tunnel if you expect smut or an evil dead ripoff stay away from this film but if you dig the finer point of the horror suspens genr check this film out yes bruce campbel did produc this movi and i m sure he s proud to tell anyon that it s not evil dead bruce ha never tri to bank on his ash imag and it s obvious that he didn t get involv with hatr so that it could do so either my advic though to all dead ite rabid devour anyth issu by mr campbel is to check this film out anyway and see what el mr kallio and mr campbel are tri to show you the act is well done although noth about this film is oscar calib perhap intent it s good to see compassion perform in a horror film so often actor in film such a these don t even seem to tri with hatr it seem a though all the actor took thier charect veri serious never resort to typic horror film campi technic hatr is about a compet a indi film get the edit is fast pace the cinematographi is good given the budget and hatr keep a quick pace without ani bog down point or bad anti climax all in all hatr may not have the gloss over look of all those multi million dollar fake indi but person i don t see a problem with that it s a film by folk who actual care about the medium peopl who reach into thier broke as pocket pull out thier nickl and dime threw caution to the wind and made a damn good movi check this one out

i can t understand what it is that fan of the genr didn t like about this film it wa truli a lot of fun the special effect were wonder i general agre with review and with imdb voter but not this time i wait until it came to home video which i felt wa anoth reason that i wouldn t enjoy the film i believ special effect film need to be seen on the big screen but again this wa not the case to me the film beg comparison to two film that were releas around the same time blair witch and the mummi both film that i thought were terribl blair wa probabl the most overr horror film of all time the mummi made gob of money and it wa pure dreck peopl like it for it s special effect film like the mummi and the haunt are not rich in charact develop they are more like funhous ride well with that analog the mummi wa a b ticket to the haunt s e ticket 
 
 
 
what can i say that hasn t been said about the haunt it ha everyth that would make a great pictur wonder set moodi music and sound design to die for were all in place the screenplay though sometim boggl the mind in such a weird surrealist way the entir team must have forgotten to read it through mayb becaus they were too busi creat cg effect and build gothic set to notic how weak the plot wa each member of the cast give a worthi perform although with littl convict to the materi at hand lili taylor ha the most to do while the other most react to her but that s about it all i can say is that it wa a slight enjoy two hour but you will definit want more a lot more 
 
 
 
i just got puzzl whi damn fox cancel the season although season wa not a good a season which is excel inde i like it so much that i even think about buy dvd on amazon fail _ i am a chine student and it s inconveni for me to get a intern credit card and i just hope fox can bring back da someday somehow 
 
 
 
i don t know whi the critic trash this movi i hard ever agre with them anyway the movi could have been a littl scarier i don t usual go to horror movi i even had to psych myself up to see it in the daytim i needn t have bother the cinema wa full of kid too heh liam wa great a alway i also like catharin zeta jone theo and lili taylor eleanor nell the hous wa veri gothic and beauti in a spooki way the special and sound effect were awesom i also love the music score particular the gentl tune for eleanor and her journey to save the child how she grew out of her stagnant routin and life and final gain her power peac and freedom 
 
 
 
i know it is fashion now to hate this movi i have seen hundr of spook film includ he origin haunt a well a most of the hammer film this film is not restrain and doe not hold back at all which is probabl whi so mani modern viewer seem not to like it yet mani viewer can accept out of control film like scream becaus knife killer are more easi to believ for most peopl than demon or ghost actual this film had mani great scene and the act and special effect were great i have seen it time now and it get better everi time the director of this film ha made a number of interest and stylish film and wa not tri for the type of realism of the th sen the haunt let go and is certain not bore perhap this film might appeal more to john carpent fan but more of an tradit plot structur the old haunt wa also a fine film from it wa even more scari see both and also the innoc and the legend of hell hous with pamela franklin 
 
 
 
the haunt is a film that boast a realli creepi hous good effect work and sound work a cast that seem to believ that everyth around them is real and that hous there are scene that make you jump and the sinist aspect of what went on at hill hous in the past i found interest there are genuin creepi moment in the film and i like the way the ghost manifest themselv in sheet curtain and the hous itself jerri goldsmith s score gave it the right atmospher and the sound design had voic pop up around you what i wish could ve happen is for someth a littl more intens jan de bont had a pg rate to contend with and i think that he held back a littl too much poltergeist scare me silli when i saw it mani year ago and it still hold up the haunt could ve use a few more scene of pure terror the end wa for me a littl anticlimact overal i enjoy it the act is good and there are moment that make you jump i just wish it scare me more

anyon who ha seen this movi and review it poor i would refer them to roger ebert s review of this movi he is one of the most respect critic in the industri and he gave it star this is a great movi it may not be perfect or spectacular but i enjoy it a chorus line is not so much a stori a it is a group of stori about the live of broadway hope i read review where peopl said that too much time wa wast on the romanc between zach and cassi that is an incorrect view it is anoth stori along with all the other stori that are told about each of the broadway hope what peopl fail to realiz is that those who are dancer for broadway show go through the same thing that the common man goe through and that i think is realli the point of the whole show it is to showcas not onli the talent of these special dancer but to give u some poignant thing to think about in regard to life in general this is a studi of life a a broadway star anyon who ha dream of becom a broadway star watch this movi with a great feel of relationship becaus they have gone through exact what the charact are go through this is a great music it ha it slow point and at time get a littl confus with the pace of certain stori line but all in all i thorough enjoy it take a closer look at the movi and then mayb you will understand what i am talk about

i ve long want to see this film be a fan of both peter cush and david mccallum i agre that the romant sub plot wa a wast of time but the talent of mccallum shine through this juvi role thank heaven for turner classic which air the show last week i can imagin that there were lot of problem with child after the war especi with the way thing were throughout the s some of the boy are a bit scari i certain wouldn t want to met them on a well lit street much le a dark one there were some good insight regard the feel of a firebug a well or a they call him a firefli 
 
 
 
man about the hous is a true situat comedi in everi sen of the word the comedi concern a charact call robin tripp play by the great richard o sullivan who find himself after a wild parti end up at the home of two ladi call jo and chrissi iron the parti wa held to say goodby to their old flatmat the obvious end up happen a he move in man about the hous wa a pre cursor to cook and mortim s spin off show georg and mildr which featur the charact who were landlord to jo chrissi and robin these two charact would actual turn out to be the linchpin of man about the hous with mildr the late and much miss yootha joyc in particular get some of the best line of the seri a semi regular charact wa larri doug fisher a useless person who wa alway on the scroung and onli ever came round when he want to borrow someth and never to return it the american s did a version call three s compani but it doesn t stand a chanc when compar to this far funnier origin thame took a risk in produc a comedi about a man share a flat with woman at a veri conserv time but they should worri a the rate at the time suggest that around million peopl just want to watch a good old fashion bit of comedi with inspir cast and a sharp script what a piti modern comedi can t reach that high standard this programm is avail on network dvd
 
 
 
like a lot of seri pilot dark angel s open show a mixtur of great potenti and a slight problem find it own foot not that this is unusu in ani way but there is a feel that it could have work better if the stori wa tighten and focus a littl more in today s world where someth ha to catch on instant or face cancel the seri did itself a bit of a disservic by not come out at least halfway focus with all gun blaze the nineti minut pilot realli feel like two episod glu togeth and both episod have a problem with focus in the first half we are introduc to max and fill in on what drive her we also get a few interest routin with max use her abil to win bet interact with a pi or sort out co worker domest problem the problem here is that this is noth out of the ordinari for ani human be with a normal set of gene on televis or otherwis it s when we hit the second half that we get a stori with a purpos and focus throughout the two halv max find herself the focus of attent from a pirat journalist who feel it is mission in life to save the world by expo one dirti dealer at a time in the second half the repercuss catch up with him and max reluct clean up the result mess this set up the premis for the entir rest of the seri and it work but it doesn t quit click if you get my mean it s like most of the piec are there but a coupl that make a complet imag have been left out perhap they get fill in with later episod but that s besid the point the fact is that the content of this episod could easili have been told with twenti eight le minut the last of the negat is that a lot of the support cast are total unendear origin cindi in particular is an annoy and i doubt that chang dure the next twenti episod while the act isn t a bad a daytim soap it isn t of such qualiti that i d commend it jessica alba is not the worst actor in the world but she doe come up short in term of be convinc when the stori need it least the good news is that the premis and the product valu are all top notch in fact this seri wa consid quit expens to produc and it is quit unfortun that it wa cancel in order to be replac by anoth show that didn t last a whole season especi when there wa ampl time for both show they could have simpli cancel one of the piec of disingeni garbag they flog under the banner of realiti tv the fact is that we need more show like dark angel where imagin rather than overhyp are use to draw the attent in all i gave the dark angel pilot a seven out of ten it never rise abov the level of throwaway televis and it never got a chanc to live up to the potenti it show within it own run time but the potenti is there and that s often all that matter where pilot are concern 
 
 
 
a is near alway the case when britain come up with an entertain and or success sit com or quiz show the yank will come along and poach the format and produc their own grossli inferior version man about the hous is of cours no except to that rule the yank version three s compani wa unwatch braindead pap that seem to run forev a prime exampl of quantiti over non exist qualiti the origin on the other hand is a fond rememb gem that had the savvi like fawlti tower to pull the plug at precis the right time unlik the episod of hilar that three s compani came up with jo wa cute there wa brilliant chemistri between the roper richard o sullivan made it all look so easi the script whilst not exact oscar wild standard were consist funni and chrissi wa the most drop dead gorgeous woman who ha walk the face of this planet sinc the dead sea wa mere feel unwel nuff said 
 
 
 
in watch this earli demill work it wa onc again reinforc to me that earli demill is far superior to late demill his attent to use of light within scene is remark his pace is veri good enabl much to be told in the space of an hour or so it is a piti that he wasn t a intuit about the style of his later sound film a he seem to be in his silent film this wa the first film in which i had seen cleo ridg she wa remark quit restrain and yet convey a broad spectrum of emot the end is wonder 
 
 
 
this film ha a clear storylin which is quit unusu to the music genr cat phantom of the opera and other andrew lloyd webber s music can be consid metaphor a they use literari work a their framework biarkan bintang menari bbm s storylin touch the veri core of human relationship especi that of indonesian peopl despit the fact the film wa base on a suppos fairytal it s actual a fantasi of the child in indonesian adult the danc sequenc are not perfect yet the song repres how indonesian express themselv i reckon the choreograph should explor indonesian way of danc by not dismay the fact that indonesia s danc develop tend to be more western the danc sequenc seem awkward in some way and not synchron with the song and or music yet i still love this movi and regard it a a new wave of indonesian film genr which i hope to improv in the futur 
 
 
 
i think dark angel is great first season wa excel and had a good plot with max jessica alba a an escap x manticor creation tri to adapt to a normal life but still save the world and be hunt by manticor throughout the season which give the seri some extra spice the second season though sudden becam a bit odd compar to the first the plot kinda disappear and the seri lost a littl of it s charm most becaus of all the weird creatur appear don t get me wrong the second season is good but with a littl bit to much of the manticor howev they manag to get back to a new promis plot in the close episod of season in which i had a lot of hope to see more of so i realli wish they could start make new episod and with jame cameron behind this it can t go wrong so a a conclus i would say it s a great seri howev i m still hope for a third season

everi time i see nicol i like her more i love a movi like this a woman you just won t give up on but she keep break your heart first movi i rememb see like this wa of human bondag the kim novak laurenc harvey version the beef about the correct of the russian spoken in this film are petti it wa good enough to fool me or anybodi el who can t speak russian i m sure funni how peopl miss the point the no goodnik russian guy were well cast too final i have to tip my hat to ben chaplin a somebodi el note he play a sap with great digniti and there wa definit some heat between him and nicol to think guy get paid for that mind blow 
 
 
 
modern origin romant stori veri good act of both nicol kidman and ben chaplin miss kidman doe a nice job in imit a russian accent ben chaplin is also good a the shi dull clerk for the men and some woman miss kidman look fantast and is veri sympathet i forgot what a gorgeous woman she is it s not hard to imagin that john fall in love with her some unexpect turn in the stori are good for the suspens although i hope for a happi end the last part of the movi wa quit a surpris for me conclus good movi le pay ba huit point 
 
 
 
when i saw birthday girl i like it so much i set out to see everi nicol kidman film i could onli to find all of them a disappoint compar to it i theoriz that while the presenc of a particular star usual guarante a certain level of qualiti becaus of their artist control with nicol kidman the influenc she exert is detriment to film enjoy imho thus for instanc dogvill even depriv the viewer of anyth visual to detract from the existenti insight she is hammer home or other film promot gay and lesbian a worthi of anyon el s attent or other pet caus of kidman s here she is a natur woman and she doe a realli great job i don t how or who wa abl to restrain her but appar it work the way the film depict her open despit her resist get to the heart of what make a woman a woman and consequ what make a man s most desper hope margin attain of cours the fact the male lead transform from a milquetoast clerk to macho man in the space of one film sound like a male ego expans fantasi but his transform is adequ believ it isn t coyli contriv a it would be in a film engin to bolster male ego instead it accur record necessari growth aris from the film uniqu circumst also quit charm is the way the crimin are portray a perfect human apart from their crimin mission her gang ha a co rough and tumbl fellowship which is foreign to american cultur and while they are his adversari they are never realli his enemi in effect they teach him to be compet i realli marvel at kidman s abil to physic appear russian it had me wonder whether her ancestri wa russian but none of the photo of her i examin show ani hint of it mayb it is just makeup but it wa amaz i can onli hope that they knock her over the head again soon so she can turn out anoth great film despit my gratuit dig at m kidman the messag is this is a superior film in everi way and probabl the role of a lifetim 
 
 
 
the first von trier movi i ve ever seen wa break the wave sure a nice movi but it definit stand in the shadow of europa europa tell a stori of a young german american who want to experi germani just after the second world war he take a job that his uncl ha arrang for him a a purser on a luxu train becaus of his job he travel all through an almost total destroy germani meet with the kill of traitor and hunt for former nazi parti member the societi is suffer from corrupt his uncl ha narrow his concious by focus on the job he ha also a a purser on the train by coincid the main charact get involv in bomb and terror by a group call werewolv they put pressur on him to help them place bomb on train the atmospher is astound the viewer is taken from scene to scene by a man attempt to put the viewer under hypnosi and then count to wake you up in a new scene just when you think you ve seen a lot europ 
 
 
 
this is a good exampl a film that in spite of the low rate is more than worth watch the stori is engag and it doesn t take long befor the chemistri between nicol kidman and ben chaplin grab your attent the act is first class and the charact are repres well sometim it feel like the director couldn t decid himself between drama and romant comedi ben chiller s portray of the law abid and shi englishman with porn s m magazin hidden in the bedroom creat plenti of moment for laugh a doe the look in nicol kidman s eye when she is offer john his first tast of intimaci in a long time other time the actor and especi nicol kidman give this comedi quit expert a dramat slant 
 
 
 
for a film that got littl public and few peopl have heard about this wa pretti good it s anoth one of these modern day british crime film that are quirki snatch sexi beast etc it s not wild like snatch but it s interest and it ha some rough charact it also ha a corni and somewhat predict end but earli in the show not late ha some neat twist to make it veri interest for the first time viewer basic it s about a low key british male who send away for a russian mail order bride who wind up with the aid of two russian male friend provid a coupl of big surpris ben chapin and nicol kidman co star and are veri good a are vincent cassel and matthieu kassovitz a kidman s russian cohort this is a differ kind of film and well act kidman onc again prove she s far more than just a beauti face 
 
 
 
this movi realli woke me up like it wake up the main male charact of this brave differ movi from his life slumber this guy john ben chaplin lead his mediocr safe life of a bank teller in a small provinci english town until the stun gorgeous wild girl to die for nadia nicol kidman order by email from russia enter his life to becom his belov wife by john plan howev a glitch turn up nadia doe not speak a word of john languag although calm and emotionless on the outsid john becom so interest in beauti nadia that instead of use the full refund polici of the match servic he buy her a dictionari to start the communic process what happen henceforth in the plot realli shake poor john from his slumber of a decent paid safe feel clerk into a decis make decent think action figur give the viewer a sublimin messag you would have probabl act likewis kidman cassel kassovitz make a great team act russian and they are almost indistinguish from the real thing almost onli due to the slight accent present in their russian dialogu howev slight enough to amaz a nativ russian by the hard work done to get the word sound right nicol kidman prove her talent onc again by play a charact quit differ from the previous role at least from the cultur background the pace of the film is fast and captiv and you certain are not readi to quit watch when the end titl appear you rather feel that you re in the middl of the plot and are left with a desir to see the sequel a soon a it come out my advic is to go out and get this film immedi and watch it and enjoy to sum it up it ha an unusu plot great act and idea below the surfac like the idea of the rude awaken from the artifici safe routin life of a wheel in a societi s machin the life which member of the fight club were so keen to quit and the machin of which pink floyd sing welcom to the machin i bet that in the end john wa rather off with sophia on their way to the unknown than not have met her at all thank you writer for the great stori and everyon el for this great movi plea make a sequel and you can stage it whereev and name the locat whatev becaus the authent of the place is irrelev to the percent of the potenti viewer i am sure of it 
 
 
 
jessica alba s max and valeri rae miller s origin cindi shine in this actionpack and atmospher serial wonder polit incorrect qualiti vari great from episod to episod but general the standard is high and when it is not jessica is alway worth look at valeri s urban jivetalk afroamerican is occate almost drag dark angel into sitcom territori 
 
 
 
teresa pavlinek wa a popular member of the toronto second citi cast she ha done numer guest spot and commerci up here in canada final someon ha the sen to creat a show for her the support case seem quit good too i have now watch the pilot sever time and i still find it refresh though i am not sure whi the show is list a the jane show i might be wrong but a far a i am awar the show wa conceptu in and appear on global tv in canada in earli it is a fresh idea and hope it doe well too bad this couldn t be pair up with corner gas now i know corner gas is on ctv but the two show would be great companion piec 
 
 
 
i m watch this on the star world network oversea which buy american and canadian seri that last one or two season like the jane show i thought of how mani femal lead comedi show im actual abl to watch on my own there s luci bewitch i dream of jeani the one with barbara feldman and then my mind goe kind of blank i cannot think of ani other the woman are all support role not the lead so for me the jane show is in pretti good compani one thing i just thought of though i ve watch sever thing made in canada and i never recal ani thing be film in a regular tv seri that show snow it s all made at the height of summer lol grant it s a great place to live climat wise in the summer but you would think they would show a littl bit of canada in the winter sinc that s part of the lifestyl there also i mean sctv just for laugh come to mind a two comedi show that last a long time film in canada and veri littl or none is shot with snow present even though they both do a lot of outdoor shot i digress but i kind of chuckl at jane and her obvious liber way be accus of racism to her neighbor and i like the bald guy and his crazi i found it on par with a uk seri call the it crowd i think anoth offic comedi with a femal lead not by ani mean the best comedi ever but for a guy to say he can watch it alon that say someth if i wa with my wife she might realli enjoy it sinc it address sex in the offic and stuff like that so might be a good light comedi for coupl to watch of 
 
 
 
spacecamp is my favorit movi it is a great stori and also inspir other the act wa excel and my wife and i went to see lea thompson in cabaret year later due to her perform in the movi it is unfortun that the challeng accid delay and hurt the movi the th anniversari of the challeng accid is come up i knew one of the challeng astronaut off and on sinc childhood on the carnegi mellon campus where my father went to school i also know a close friend of the late pilot i wa the technic review last year for nation bsa for the boy scout astronomi merit badg and i still find spacecamp a great movi to recommend to scout do the space relat merit badg i teach i ran into the late astronaut again a an adult and wa follow a schedul of engin educ we had put togeth when challeng blew up i wound up sit in with willard rockwel and his engin invis go over thing after the accid at the astrotech stockhold meet by chanc a a result so i m much closer to the accid and ani movi similar i made sure that i wa a good student and finish the degre four year later strang enough on the recommend of the rockwel engin who told them not to fli challeng in and who later built endeavour 
 
 
 
spacecamp is one of the movi that kid just love and mom and dad can have fun watch a well grow up in the s i enjoy this movi it s plot and all the actor i recent purchas this movi on dvd so when i have kid of my own they will be abl to have a much fun watch this movi a i did the plot is fun a group of kid embark on a journey they never expect when they were rocket into space by a overachiev robot they were in auh at first but when they realiz they didn t have enough oxygen to make it back panic sunk in onc they recov enough oxygen from the space station they return to earth a even better friend and a new found respect for life 
 
 
 
i ve been read through some of the other user comment and decid to put one in too some of the user are stuck in a realist type of mental this film wa meant to be a fantasi a what if fun film it wa never meant to be real or serious it wa thorough enjoy for everyon i knew when it came out even though it shadow the tragedi of the challeng explos i wa at the time and total enjoy this one my young son love it too later i share it with my daughter and she too love it spacecamp is a fun famili film that should be enjoy for just that fun all the realist in the world should lighten up or stick to watch documentari or docudrama and avoid ani other type of film so sorri for those young folk who watch this movi first and then were abl to go to the real spacecamp one in alabama and one at vandenberg afb in california they must have gone expect to find the same type of environ that wa portray in the movi and then felt letdown i guess their parent didn t explain the differ between fantasi and realiti oh well if you love fantasi fun film and haven t seen this one i high recommend it enjoy 
 
 
 
space camp is a pretti decent film the plot is predict but the actor do a good job and the special effect are decent for the time this film wa origin releas about the time of the shuttl disast and that realli put a hamper on how popular it wa the scene where the shuttl door open in space is simpli spectacular on the big screen that is on a tv it just look averag i rememb this scene in the theater it made you feel like you were realli up there this would be a good film to see on imax but i m sure that will never happen 
 
 
 
to my surpris i quit enjoy spacecamp i rememb see it about year ago and recent i hire it again i wa quit impress obvious the special effect in today space film such a armageddon and deep impact are far superior to those in spacecamp howev this film had a stori a veri stereotyp eighti stori where you could almost recit the next line of dialogu befor hear it but that what i like about it they don t make film like this anymor so it wa a refresh chang it wa interest to see kelli preston leaf phoenix and lea thomson in earli role with tom skerrit and kate capshaw to add substanc to the light fluffi plot absolut love the robot name jinx it wa veri cute but it unfortun had more emot than some of the main charact the film wa almost inspir in it own way and it wa interest to note that it wa film at the nasa spacecamp in alabama i think 
 
 
 
this is a famili film which to some peopl is an automat turn off it seem that too mani peopl do not want to see film that are not load down with fail arm and leg gratuit violenc and enough explet to fill the new york phone book this film is none of those it is clich it is formula but it is also fun it doesn t ask you to think it doesn t demand that you accept the film a realiti it simpli doe what a good film ought to do which is to will suspend disbelief for two hour and enjoy the adventur the cast is good while not excel a anoth comment point out the john william sound score wa a usual excel and the fact that a lot of the film wa shot in huntsvill at the real space camp made it even more believ it wa iron that the origin releas of the film wa delay for some month due to the challeng shuttl disast which may have play a larg part in it s origin theatric open but the film eventu ha help to focus the dream of mani young peopl back toward space and the possibl that lie therein so sit back with your kid and prepar to enjoy 
 
 
 
the perfect space fantasi film a group of kid go up accident in space and have to get back down but do they sure they do this would not be a famili film if they all die then it will all be sad you don t want that kate capsaw the lead ladi give a golden globe perform but sad she nor lea thompson won one that suck so bad i can t say it enough this film is so great lea thompson o lord a perfect girl for this film this film is the best for sure sorri but better than star war star war is so over rate and space camp wa so under rate it should of been the other way around excel r mayb iam not good at math
 
 
 
a few summer space camper actual were accid sent into space by a robot and the oxygen in ship wa run short they had to sent someon to a space station to get the gas tank etc etc first of all this movi s plot is not possibl in real life but it give a warm feel of anyth is possibl if you set your heart in it is amaz to see those young actor who still look about the same after so mani year i saw this movi for the first time in the year of it wa film in there are quit a few peopl in that movi who are still work in hollywood the view wa great from outer space it doe not look unreal it is about hour long it run so fast that you won t even notic you know that it is not real but you just get suck into it until the end overal it is a good famili movi 
 
 
 
unfortun spacecamp came out about the same time a the challeng explos which realli put a crimp on when to bring it out or even if they should bring it out i m glad they did i first watch spacecamp at a drive in movi which realli enhanc the view a lot while i had heard of lea thompson and tom skerritt i had never heard of the other in the movi so it came a a big shock to me to find all those youngster act and act real good of cours kate capshaw wa excel too i especi like the scene where those kid were be shown how to act a a team the scene of the kid be prepar for a trip they could onli hope for the actual launch of a spacecraft is of cours old news to u howev this one wa differ all in all this is one of my most treasur film escapist mayb but it wa fantast for a space nut like me after probabl rent it for time i final found it avail in a certain store and bought it now if it onli come out on dvd i will probabl have it forev this movi get a out of from me 
 
 
 
i notic the dvd version seem to have miss scene or line between the post of the frf and the launch they are to prove they can win the right to sit in the frf other than the green team anoth scene is like dure their failur at the simul kevin get joaquin to clam down i think the vhs edit other than the abc one might have all the miss stuff otherwis i like to know which dvd releas ha the miss stuff the dvd i have watch feel edit for televis 
 
 
 
i could see this film is super he didn t surpris to oneself when so that it wa take place for the truth this way by itself how swig flight to the which didn t have the place but it is onli such an conspiratori theori right veri i like watch this film when i wa the child i am interest which so that it wa if it turn out that such a flight wa take place realli certain to it for not a belief becaus it is deni logic and the common sen who at healthi sen sent to kid with space shuttl into the orbit i veri like read for the subject american and soviet space program i know a few mission of space shuttl remain provid by cia with the claus top secret certain these are onli such my divag but who know 
 
 
 
wow this film is the best live testament i think of what happen on in nyc compar to anyth shown by the major medium outlet those outlet can onli show you what happen on the outsid this film show you what happen on the insid it begin with a focus on a rooki new york fireman wait for week for the first big fire that he will be call to fight the subject matter turn abrupt with the onli exist footag of the first plane to hit the tower you are then given a front row seat a firefight rush to the scene into the lobbi of tower one in the minut that preced the crash of the second plane and tower two s subsequ fall you see fireman react to the unsettl sound of peopl land abov the lobbi it is a sight you will not soon forget heart rend tear jerk and veri compel from the first minut to the last deserv to go down in histori a one of the best documentari film ever made we must never forget

super slick entertain with a stellar cast an outstand script and a firm grip on the approach s at the time rko wa turn out classic noir by the dozen but whatev the valu of those shadowi downer they reflect a war time mood soon to give way the sunnier clime of the eisenhow era few film of the late s are further from that noir cycl or more attun to the come consum decad than this sassi littl comedi jim bland cari grant work a an ad man on madison ave where in his littl daughter s word he sell thing to peopl that they don t need at price they can t afford he s make good money but like thousand of other he s tire of live in a cramp urban cave so with wife myrnah loy they strike out after their dream hous in the wild of the connecticutt countrysid needle to say in the arm of natur they get more than they bargain for and in hilari fashion there s hard a lifeless line in the entir script i don t know if writer panama and frank got an oscar but they should have of cours the humor revolv around all the problem that pop up when citi peopl build a big hous on rural land the annoy pile up almost a fast a the mortgag with all the eccentr type run the construct show and give grant a hard time of cours no one carri off annoy or frustrat more humor than grant so it s just one well place laugh after anoth particular when the lock closet appear to have an infern mind of it own yet odd the film appear to have no comed high point instead the laugh are space out so expert that they don t peak at ani particular point that s a real movi triumph for ani era reach back year later we can see how deft the script idea look ahead rather than behind with their live in maid the bland may not be a typic american famili but that post war migrat from cramp citi to spacious suburbia wa typic and what more suggest job for the come consumer than bland a an ad man task with find catchier way to sell more ham more than anyth howev there s the movi s sunni optim oh sure the feel falter at time yet the belief that a better futur is on the horizon if the bland just stick to their dream carri them through inde life wa go to improv for a lot of peopl dure the come surg so i expect the film reson deepli with audienc of the day it s that easili over look subtext along with the sheer entertain valu that make this movi a key comedi statement of the post war period so if you haven t seen it catch it next time around

 radiofreccia is still a good surpris in italian cinema the film is base on a book of italian songwrit luciano ligabu who also direct the movi and write the music score of cours the film is a portrait of north italian provinc life in the emilia romagna region we re in the time of the first free radio one of the boy of the movi creat radioraptus youth wish friendship love sex individu drama and unemploy are among the theme but the film speak also about drug freccia the main charact is a victim of heroin slaveri without be bore and moralist the stori flow veri well the spontan of actor is strong and the way of direct a well obvious luciano liga ligabu is neither fellini nor a movi profession first of all he s a musician but he succeed in make a good product unfortun he ll not repeat the success with his second movi da zero a dieci not good at all in radiofreccia actor are general not veri famous the onli star is stefano accorsi one of the most popular young italian actor see in a small role anoth italian songwrit francesco guccini he s the nice communist barman and footbal trainer 
 
 
 
now this show look like most of the other show of it s type from the mid s but the onli thing is about this one is that it s differ they use a lot of comedi and action in this one and mayb a littl bit of drama too i person thought it wa a good show i can t understand whi would they cancel it the good thing is that the fan base of this show is still aliv ever sinc up to date my hope is that the wb bring back the show or even do a movi which i know is gonna be imposs to do but hey it doesn t hurt to dream doesn t it anyway i would recommend if you hadn t seen it to find the dvd of all episod becaus the charact are great the stori line are good the comedi is good and well the whole show is just great

japanes tomo akiyama s keko mask is extrem enjoy trash film and so fun to watch there are also some sequel but i haven t seen them sinc these film are hyper rare some kind of re releas some day would be nice sinc i think mani trash lover would like these film the tongu in cheek stori is about one extrem strict school in which teacher think that it is okay to tortur student in order to attain disciplin which is accord to the teacher the most import thing in educ the school is lead by incred funni look just look at the costum human wizard whatev who is like princip in the school and it onli add to the campi that it is never explain whi he wear such a costum sinc all other teacher are perfect normal cloth well the main thing about the film is it name keko mask who is some beauti and mask fairi who come alway to save the girl and student who are abus and tortur by the teacher yes this superheroin is one effect femal a she kick and fight the evil teacher with total cheesi soundtrack play on the background the most import thing is of cours that she wear noth but a cape and a mask with the rest of her bodi nake her ident is never reveal in these film and also the credit say keko mask unknown while the actor name are list the most hilari thing in this film is how keko mask kill her enemi she ha a gorgeous but lethal vagina yes you read right she kill her victim by fli in the air in front of them spread her leg and let the enemi becom numbl charm of the view after which she fli closer and snap their neck with her leg the most usual last line the charact say in this film are like i ve never seen such a beauti vagina and now i can die in peac this film is total fantast there are also some great taunt toward japanes societi for exampl it attitud toward sex in film japanes censor optic fog blur all the pubic hair in ani film and also about some restrict among school student like girl and boy are not allow to talk in this film etc there s one great scene in which one nerd see girl s bare you know what for the first time and say hey there s no fog in it i couldn t help but laugh dure this scene a i thought what do the japanes censor think about this also one charact say in the end that he will return if japan film allow to make the sequel i m glad it allow a i ve heard the sequel are equal outrag one sequel should includ blue brother yes those blue brother in it etc this is trash in it most enjoy funniest and also cleverest form and so it is a littl shame these film are so hard to find this would definit be even greater experi if it wa littl more fast move at time a it becom littl bore at one point but fortun those segment are veri few this film ha to be seen to be fulli believ a there are so mani trash element i don t mention here and it wouldn t be even necessari to tell them all here if you like trash cinema and film made with tongu in veri cheek i think you ll love this littl gem a i do and the director is definit a genius in this field perhap the onli film in which a shine vagina is this lethal 
 
 
 
i turn this on to see the incred ethel water whose autobiographi i am now read i ll admit my jaw drop when the pork chop and watermelon refer start roll in but peopl cannot look at this movi a a stereotyp or racist piec it s pretti much a short film made by black for black at a time when the entertain industri wa quit segreg and the stereotyp to the peopl involv were the joke of their time old trend exagger for humor we see modern black movi do the same thing but with the new trend stereotyp ho s and the hood and such i think if you look back in eighti year you would find today s movi will look just a racist what viewer should appreci about this film is the talent of water and the pint size sammi davi jr who out tap his contemporari shirley templ and look remark the same facial a he did a an adult everyon involv in this film clear had a lot of fun make it whi not enjoy it for what it is instead of what you think it should have been 
 
 
 
given the opposit circumst of where the realiti is we do have a black presid this movi take on quit a power histor signific for entertain valu i found this movi to be both engag and repugn i wa quit taken back of cours by the blatant racism of the time but also found the music and danc incred also it is quit cool to see sammi davi jr a such a veri young child actor he play rufus jone a young boy who is be consol by his mammi he is told whi some day you could be presid this wa so ridicul in that it wa mock and thought to be endear charm and funni the bulk of the movi is a fantasi sequenc of what the govern would be like if it wa run by a black man they depict the seat of govern a be like a revivalist baptist church the fact wa when i stumbl onto this movi one day it drew me in it is realli well done and veri entertain i believ if we can look beyond the racism we can see this movi for all it bring u in fact to realiz that it is not onli not ridicul to have a black presid but that it is normal just make this movi that much more relev it clear mark a moment in time for our collect conscious 
 
 
 
sure this movi wasn t like block insid man an american haunt etc but it wa a great mysteri that can happen to anyon of u i found this movi realli great and scari i live exact where they film this movi san pedro california and we have heard true stori base on incid of this movi i dunno if you ve heard of the famous boat in long beach queen mari well that boat is haunt i believ in spirt illus and parallel or howev u spell that is real everybodi s in there own univers and the mind is a power thing i recommend to watch this movi it s great and not bad direct at all for those who rate it a they don t understand the film it mean it plot it view and how bad the ocean life can be for each and everyon of u ty victor
 
 
 
one of the great classic comedi not a slapstick comedi not a heavi drama a fun satir film a buyer bewar guid to a new home fill with great charact all of whom cari grant is convinc are out to fleec him in the build of a dream home a great look at life in the late s 
 
 
 
i also saw this upon it releas in and have been struck sinc then with it final scene if this is an answer to high noon then it s an apt and apposit respons the notion that a this string is head the town come togeth is a much stronger messag than the lone person heroism of high noon in this theme concho is a phenomen precursor of one my other all time favorit the magnific seven both sinatra and conrad give impress and convinc perform especi sinatra s transform from bulli kid brother to liber town savior i can onli hope that at some point all the friend and famili on whom over the year i ve inflict my affect for this movi will have the opportun to experi it for themselv 
 
 
 
i wa lucki enough to get to see this film mani year ago in england i ve seen hundr of film sinc but i ve never forgotten this one although sinatra wa play a not veri endear charact he wa excel in the role a lot of peopl seem to think that he did nt realli come into his own until his role in from here to etern but in my opinion he wa magnific in concho the other role that stick in my mind is that of william conrad i d never see or heard of him befor this film conrad play a terrif part in this film i rememb his deep and gravelli voic and he use it beauti to enhanc the few word he speak with a menac that set the tone of his charact also i rememb the music that both introduc conrad and and seem to surround him whenev he appear an excel film and my onli disappoint wa that i never ever got the chanc to see it again it seem to have disappear from the face of the earth i see in the titl that it say that the film is in black and white but when i saw it wa inde in full color i rememb sinatra s blue shirt 
 
 
 
 still crazi is without a doubt the greatest rock comedi of all time it ha been erron compar to this is spinal tap which it ha no relat to spinal tap is a satir and quit frank not a veri good one in spite of it s outing of mani rock clich s unlik tap still crazi is popul by great actor great song and great human situat you care about the peopl in still crazi that s all that matter oh yeah the music s pretti damn good too written by mick jone of foreign and chris difford of squeez american audienc were alreadi familiar with stephen rea the cri game but would onli later becom familiar with bill nighi underworld love actual pirat of the caribbean ii and timothi spall the harri potter movi 
 
 
 
i have rare emerg from view a film with such a warm happi feel i felt a if i had been out with realli good friend and had a wonder time i thorough enjoy this film the act wa superb although i would have to mention bill nye in particular a give an absolut faultless perform bill is an excel actor and would love to see him in more film timothi spall and jimmi nail are also favourit and alway love to see them a they give such a solid perform and billi connolli a alway total gorgeous it wa a wonder ensembl perform from all concern such a refresh experi to see a well written superbl act and good look movi 
 
 
 
i watch the movi in a preview and i realli love it the cast is excel and the plot is sometim absolut hilari anoth highlight of the movi is definit the music which hope will be releas soon i recommend it to everyon who like the british humour and especi to all musician go and see it s great 
 
 
 
i enjoy still crazi more than ani film i have seen in year a success band from the s decid to give it anoth tri they start by play some gig in some seedi european venu with hilari result the music is fantast the script and act are terrif the charact are spot on especi the lead singer with the high heavi metal voic makeup and person problem the concert at the end wa unreal go and see it prefer in a cinema with a good sound system 
 
 
 
an excel cast make this movi work all of the charact are develop exceed well and it s clear that the actor enjoy film this movi it s not quit the comedi i expect much more a lightheart look at the attempt to reclaim youth glori than bawdi humor for music fan there are quit a few subtl refer that in themselv are intellig funni i hate draw direct comparison to other movi but so much of this movi remind me of alan parker film i can t help it imagin if the commit actual did make it big and then tri to recaptur said glori year later 
 
 
 
i thought this movi wa fantast it wa hilari kinda remind me of spinal tap this is a must see for ani fan of s rock i hope me and my friend aren t like that in twenti year bill nighi give an excel perform a the off kilter lead singer tri to recaptur that old spirit stephen rea fit perfect into the movi a the glue tri to hold the band togeth but not succeed well if you love music and were ever in a band this movi is definit for you you won t regret see this movi i know i don t even my famili found it funni and that s say someth 
 
 
 
in the voic over which begin the film hughi billi connolli a roadi for the great s band strang fruit said the reason lightn struck at a rock festiv to stop strang fruit s set wa that god wa sick of s excess inde it s been popular to put down that era of music and see punk a a welcom antidot to it while i agre the excess wa tiresom a well a the misogynist urg which came out of it and like punk i still am a fan of what is consid classic rock or glam rock and this film about strang fruit s long strang reunion is an affection tribut to those day one of the reason the film work is the care of the peopl behind the scene brian gibson direct what s love got to do with it about tina turner while i had problem with the dramat part of the film the music wa handl veri well writer dick clement and ian le frenai co wrote the commit and were behind the music orient british tv show over the rainbow and the song strang fruit play were co written by foreign s mick jone not to be confus with the clash s mick jone so it wa a meet of peopl who knew what they were talk about also two cast member are musician in their own right bill nye i don t know about though the film credit him with his own sing and he certain look like a lead singer of that era while jimmi nail wa in anoth british tv show which wa music orient though i forget the name and he wa in evita and the other are convinc at it and while a i said a lot of s band like strang fruit behav bad toward woman the movi doesn t make the same mistak except for the woman who follow timothi spall around a the manag of the reunion juliet aubrey is quit good and play a fulli round charact the other actor are all good a well with special prais to stephen rea who handl the more dramat role well without sentiment there are a coupl of plot point which don t work but overal this is quit enjoy oh yeah and the music is good too 
 
 
 
so i rent still crazi instead when i describ hardcor logo to the guy at the video store he said that sound kind of like still crazi so i rent it wa i disappoint well yes a still crazi focus on a classic rock band rather than a punk band but that s ok still crazi tell the stori of the strang fruit a rock band that broke up in the s at the peak of their popular at a larg rock festiv twenti year later the band member are all struggl to make a live and are offer the opportun to play a concert at the twenti year anniversari of this festiv they take up the offer and decid to reform on a perman basi tour europ in the process some quit funni hijink ensu and all the charact go through subtl chang watch this movi you feel more like a viewer of a care edit documentari than a particip and that s not bad at all 
 
 
 
what happen to wash up rock n roll star in the late s they launch a comeback reunion tour at least that s what the member of strang fruit a fiction s stadium rock group do toni stephen rea ha the concess on condom vend machin when he run into the son of the promot of a famous music festiv it wa at that festiv in the s that strang fruit broke up the s are retro and the time is right to wide that wave he set off in search of the other member of the band part of what broke up the band wa the death and replac of keith the lead singer and brilliant song writer the band wa known for it excess lifestyl and now they are all back amongst the work class from which they came beano the drummer play by timothi spall who wa brilliant in secret and lie is a layabout the bass player is a roofer and their lead singer is still a rocker while he own a huge mansion he ha been forc to sell it a his fortun ha not last brian the lead guitarist is dead so a young guitarist is hire to replac him somewhat reluct the band agre to give the reunion a tri abandon their day job they begin to rehears and their manag approach their label about reissu their album but he want them to start tour again first and so they hit the club circuit around europ the club scene is not kind to these overweight date old rocker it is on tour that the film realli start to develop all of the old conflict rearis with the figur of keith and brian hover throughout they all hang togeth becaus they are all in search of a second chanc for the great that elud them earlier and they rediscov some of the interperson chemistri that made play togeth so enjoy still crazi start a spinal tap ii but gradual becom a more dramat focus film follow the relationship of the band member while it is still a veri funni movi it is the evolv charact struggl to deal with the death of brian and keith and with their own person demon that make the film work

not to be confus with the res witherspoon high school film of the same name this is a stylis look at hong kong s triad gang call elect becaus a new leader or chairman is elect by ancient tradit everi two year two candid are up for the posit and through ego bribe and past track record the race is ten to say the least expert direct to introduc you to an expans cast without ever be confus the stori twist and turn befor reveal itself in all it brutal glori the asian godfath this is not but it is an enjoy thriller in a gangster genr that will leav you on the edg of your seat and winc at the violenc subtitl volum i think it safe to say there will other instal a we go deeper into the murki world of the triad and all their feud and underhand busi deal either way this is a good start and if there are no sequel a great film in it own right 
 
 
 
this movi wa a fair entertain comedi about murphi s law be appli to home ownership and construct if a film like this wa be made today no doubt the famili would be dysfunct sinc it wa set in the simpler forti we get what is suppos to be a typic famili of the era grant of cours perfect blend the comed and dramat element and he work with a more than compet support cast highlight by loy and dougla their shenanigan make for a solid nineti minut of entertain 
 
 
 
this isn t a violent a i wa expect which make the violent scene appear all the more brutal and effect there are a lot of twist and turn and back stab and doubl cross all the way through the film make it hard to know who s side a particular charact is on the plot is pacey with some good dialogu and charact develop and give an interest view of the work of the triad gang it follow the violenc when it come is brutal no gun or martial art scene with special effect this is believ in your face violenc and for all the dialogu you are never allow forget that the triad is a violent crimin organis the end is surpris but thorough consist and believ 
 
 
 
there can be no deni that hak se wui elect in english is a well made and well thought out film the film use numer clever piec of identif all the time play with modern yet stick to tradit a theme play with throughout the film where john woo s hong kong film are action pack and over the top in their explos content a seen in hard boil and when hong kong film do settl down into rhythm of tell the stori from the bad point of view they can sometim stutter and just becom mere unmemor a good exampl be citi on fire elect is a film that is memor for the sheer fact of it unpredict scene spontan action and violenc that are done in a realist and tast if that s the right word manner a well a the clever littl in piec of film make it s difficult to spot dure the view but elect is realli construct in a kind of three act structur there is the first point of concern involv the actual elect and whoever is vote in is vote in not everyon like the decis but what the uncl say goe the second act is the retriev of the ancient baton from china that tradit demand must be present dure the inaugur with the final third the aftermath of the inaugur and certain charact come up with their own idea on how the triad should and could be run needle to say certain event and twist occur dure each of the three third some are small and immateri wherea some are much larger and spectacular elect doe have some fault with the major come in the open third tri to kill off time surround an elect that onli take a few minut to complet wa clear a hard task for the writer and filmmak and that show at numer point i got the feel that a certain scene wa just start to go somewher befor it wa interrupt by the polic and then everyon get arrest this happen a few time a fight break out in a restaur but the polic are there and everyon is arrest there s a secret meet about the baton between the triad but the polic show up and everyon get arrest some other triad are have a pre elect talk but the polic show up and guess what you know onc the film get out of that rut that i thought it would it use a sacr baton a a plot devic to get everybodi move the baton spawn some good fight scene such a the chase of a truck after it s been hotwir anoth chase involv a motorbik and a kung fu fight with a load of mele weapon in a street the scene are unpredict realist and violent but like i said they are in a tast manner where elect realli soar is it attent to that fine detail when the triad are in jail the bar are cover with wire suggest they re all anim in cage a that s how they behav on the outsid when in conflict anoth fine piec of attent to detail is the way the uncl toast use tea and not alcohol elev themselv abov other head gangster who d use champagn the long good friday and also referenc chine tradit of drink tea to celebr or commemor elect is a good film that is structur well enough to enjoy and a film that ha fantast mise en scene a you look at what s go on some of the indoor set and the cloth a well a the bucket of style that is pour on a the search and chase for the baton intensifi the inaugur is like anoth short film entir and veri well integr into the film hint at chine tradit in the process i feel the best scene is the end scene a it sum it up perfect two shifti charact fish and debat the rule of the triad all the while remain realist unpredict and violent in a tast manner of cours 
 
 
 
elect is a chine mob movi or triad in this case everi two year an elect is held to decid on a new leader and at first it seem a toss up between big d toni leung ka fai or a i know him the other toni leung and lok simon yam who wa judg in full contact though onc lok win big d refus to accept the choic and goe to whatev length he can to secur recognit a the new leader unlik ani other asian film i watch featur gangster this one is not an action movi it ha it bloodi moment when necessari a in goodfella but it s basic just a realli effect drama there are a lot of charact which is realli hard to keep track of but i think that play into the crazi of it all a bit a year old baton which is the symbol of power i mention befor chang hand sever time befor thing settl down and though it may appear that the film end at the or minut mark there are still a coupl big surpris wait simon yam wa my favorit charact here and sort of anchor the pictur elect wa quit the award winner at last year s hong kong film award win for best actor toni leung best pictur best director johnni to who did heroic trio and best screenplay it also had nomin for cinematographi edit film score which i love and three more act perform includ yam 
 
 
 
first off i must say that i made the mistak of watch the elect film out of sequenc i say unfortun becaus after see elect first elect seem a bit of a disappoint both film are gangster epic that are similar in form and while elect is an enjoy piec of cinema it s just not near a good a it s sequel in the first elect instal we are shown the two competitor for chairman big d and lok after a few scene of discus amongst the uncl s a to who should have the chairman titl they almost unanim decid that lok simon yam will helm the triad suffic to say this doesn t go over veri well with competitor big d toni leung ka fai and in a bid to influenc the takeov big d kidnap two of the uncl in order to sway the elect board to his side this ha disastr result and head the triad into an all out war lok is determin to becom chairman but won t becom offici until he can recov the dragon head baton a materi represent of the chairman s power the current chairman whistl chung wang ha hidden the baton somewher in mainland china and the race is on to see who can recov it first much of the film is devot to the recoveri of the baton a both aspir leader search for it they must dodg cop and opposit side which lead into one of the stand out scene in elect which involv an underl name jet nick cheung a machet and lot of bad guy nick cheung s presenc is attent grab to say the least i wonder if this influenc director johhni to in ani way while make the second elect a he doe deliv more of jet s charact in the sequel while nick cheung give a scene steal perform i must not fail to give due to the rest of the film s actor elect ha a great ensembl cast with well thought out perform that are both subtl and impact simon yam is his usual glorious self and the film also benefit from heavyweight hk actor like loui koo toni leung ka fai and the under appreci suet lam there realli aren t ani weak link in the act and one could easili believ that they re watch real gangster although the perform are great one of the most impress thing about elect is johnni to s eye for the camera there are some truli strike shot in the film and it goe without say that to definit know how to frame his shot a the viewer is treat to a seri of innov and quit brilliant camera place and angl all of which make elect abov all a great look film my issu with the film aris most out of the shear amount of charact involv in elect it get a bit hard to follow becaus the film is so full of charact that aren t integr to the plot while the sequel opt to focus more on the two candid the first elect offer the elect process a a whole with ton of uncl underl and polic offic crowd the storylin mayb the film would have work better if it would have been a bit longer with more time dedic to the inner work of the triad or if director johnni to would have funnel down the necessari element and expound on them more bottom line all in all this is a wonder brutal film with a great cast excel direct and leisur pace that pack a punch it s just a littl more complic than it need to be 
 
 
 
i spot in the guid to film list for the santa barbara film festiv where i went when i wa in hollywood that this film wa in screen basic there is an elect for the new chairman of the hong kong triad wo sing societi come up so you can imagin how much violenc that is go to occur dure this the struggl is between candid lam lok simon yam and big d toni leung ka fai for control of the oldest and most power triad part of the societi also star loui koo a jimmi lee nick cheung a jet cheung siu fai a mr so lam suet a big head and lam ka tung a kun there are some good realist corrupt theme and moment just about enough action apart from mayb when the cop get involv but a sequel follow so it s a pretti worthwhil crime drama thriller veri good 
 
 
 
i alway thought this would be a long and bore talk head flick full of static interior take dude i wa wrong elect is a high fascin and thorough captiv thriller drama take a deep and realist view behind the origin of triad ritual charact are constant on the move and although a a viewer you kinda alway remain an outsid it s still possibl to feel the suspens come from certain decis and ambit of the charact furthermor johnni to succeed in creat some truli opul imag due to meticul compos light and atmospher light shadow contrast although there s hard ani action the end is still shock in it s ruthless depict of brutal cool movi that deserv more attent and i came to like the minimalist acoust guitar score quit a bit 
 
 
 
the first of two film by johnni to this film won mani award but none so prestigi a a cann golden palm nomin the triad elect their leader but it is far from democrat with the behind the scene machin toni leung ka fai zhou yu s train ash of time redux is big d who plan to take the baton no matter what it take even if it mean a war well war is not go to happen a that is bad for busi big d will chang his tune or good perform by simon yam loui koo and ka tung lam infern affair i iii along with toni leung ka fai whether mason made men in the mafia or member of the wo sing societi the ceremoni are the same fascin to watch to be continu 
 
 
 
elect mark the nd trial societi theme movi direct by johnni to to marvel cast simon yan and toni leung kar fai a lok and big d a the two trial member who were chosen a candid for the posit of chairman for ho sing societi a year old trial societi while lok is a man who keep his cool at all time big d is not onli impati but also think that he is on top of everyth lok wa chosen a the next chairman for year to have the total control of the gang the newli elect chairman must be pas down with a dragon baton which repres power and author big d wa extrem unhappi with the result that he wa not chosen to be the next chairman after pay a handsom figur of bribe to the council member he order his man to get the baton befor it fall onto the hand of lok while big d is get the baton lok ha other plan for him this is one of the trial societi theme movi where not much bloodsh is need johnni to put the greed of the human be in the movi where bloodsh is common use in other trial societi theme movi to show how the greed of human be can caus the death or the downfal of one howev no singl bullet is use hard ani gangfight are involv in elect it s the battl of the wit that make elect stand out of the rest apart from maggi shiu the onli actress in elect with le than line to talk in the whole movi masculin rule the whole movi loui koo and nick cheung who wa seen in to s previous film are cast a an undercov cop and a gangster who sold his life to the gang respect togeth with some of the veteran actor make their appear in the film and the excel script it make the onli hk movi to repres cann fil festiv elect ha hard fail ani critic who want an differ trial societi theme movi

i wa realli excit about see this film i thought final australia had made a good film but i wa wrong this wa the most pathet attempt at a slasher film ever i feel sorri for molli ringwald have to come all the way to australia to make an aw movi the act wa terribl especi that australian guy who wa tri to speak in an american accent and the plot wa also pretti bad when i first heard about this film come out i thought that the titl wa pathet becaus it sound like the cheesi film stab in scream but i wa will to let it slide if it wa a good movi warn major spoiler probabl the worst thing about the film wa the end i wa expect a big surpris about who the killer wa but the killer wasn t even human which turn this realist slasher film into an aw horror movi don t see this film you ll probabl be disappoint 
 
 
 
i saw this movi with a bunch of friend and although onli two of u walk out of the cinema think how cool it wa the other just laugh and comment on how stupid it wa well that wa becaus it isn t suppos to be taken so serious basic it is a a movi that mock horror flick and doe a damn good job there seem to be anoth movi come out like that too umm scari movi well this is aussi and origin jessica napier doe a surperb perform and sarah kant ha a defin bright futur in act i hope to see more of them molli ringwald wa a good move and kyli wa an even better move the imposs princess wa queen of the screen i recommend see this flick a you ll be guess until the veri end the connect with raffi hilari and the movi that never got finish year ago 
 
 
 
i have been want to see cut sinc the day i have heard of it which wa sometim last year anyway i got to see today and when the movi start i thought that it start rather week but it got better after min or so i thought that the movi wa pretti good but the thing i didn t like wa how the killer wa creat i wa think just befor i rent that it would probabl suck just like urban legend final cut i almost die it most everyth in ul final cut need to be improv cut is time better than ul final cut the best part of cut is the killer and the death scene the killer kick mo f ing as i give cut a out of 
 
 
 
it isn t the worst film ever made the actor aren t apal and the script and director are not complet inept it isn t the best film ever made the actor aren t excel and the script and director are not complet brilliant it fall somewher in the middl a fun somewher an enjoy well construct somewher no need to say don t take it serious or so bad it good or it wasn t scari none of these comment are relev cut ha atmospher it s that atmospher which is actual veri uniqu and the one realli origin aspect of the movi which person is what make the film for me 
 
 
 
 cut is a full tilt spoof of the slasher genr and in the main it achiev what it set out to do most of the standard slasher clich are there the old creepi hous the wood the anonym indestruct serial killer bucket of gore and of cours the coupl interrupt by the killer while they re have sex that s hard a spoiler the set up is simplic itself film school nerd set out to complet an unfinish slasher masterpiec unfinish becaus of the murder of a coupl of the cast this also neat okay messili dispos of kyli minogu in the first reel they are join by one of the survivor of the origin film play by molli ringwald who absolut steal the film becaus she get all the best line the rest of the cast fit their role well especi the love jessica napier who play it straight while the mayhem and gore erupt around her there are plenti of red herring and fake suspens moment and there is veri littl time to tri to work out who the killer is becaus the film move at such a fast pace it also ha an appropri low budget look includ some clumsi edit which is probabl deliber good soundtrack too if there is a difficulti with this film it is decid whether it is a send up of or a homag to the slasher genr probabl a bit of both 
 
 
 
this is not a bad movi it follow the new convent of modern horror that is the movi within a movi the well known actress run for her life in the first scene this movi take the old convent of a psycho killer on he loo and manag to do someth new and interest with it it is also alway nice to see molli ringwald back for the attack so this might be an exampl of what the genr ha becom cut hit all the mark and is actual scari in some part i like it i gave it an eight

a most recommend masterpiec not onli for the under theme of the stori but also for the unmatch brilliant and ingeni pictur work of angelopoulo not to mention the act of giant mastroianni and moreau and the remark charact play by ilium logothethi gregori karr s perform may seem overshadow by his tough partner at first stanc but in fact he perfect play his charact which is reveal in his veri last scene with the girl khrysikou and the man mastroianni albeit hint beforehand henc the spoiler get your expect straight it s an art movi in whatev mean that phrase ha to offer and requir attent not for spend free time but for watch an artwork with the necessari concentr a in read a book or attend a concert due to the overal photograph style larg screen view is recommend dialogu are use spare but the film includ in addit to the standard greek and english speak fragment spoken in albanian kurdish and turkish which will be attract for those who are charm by the beauti in hear various languag 
 
 
 
enjoy this film with plenti of veteran classic actor and especi william powel dr lawrenc bradford mister robert who play the role a a doctor and detect dr bradford wa onc marri to jean arthur paula bradford shane and got a divorc and still they manag to live with each other and also fight all the time paula want her husband to investig a homicid and did everyth she could to convinc him it wa veri import jean arthur play a rather nutti type and there is plenti of comedi and the method of murder is someth you will never believ especi with a jockey on a california race track robert armstrong nick martel king kong gave a great support role a a booki along with jame gleason a detect who need the help of dr bradford in order to solv this veri strang murder mysteri if you see this film just rememb it wa produc and direct in and the peopl in the audienc in those day thought this wa great entertain and it realli wa in those day 
 
 
 
i ve seen the thin man seri powel and loy are definit great but there is someth aw sweet about powel and arthur s chemistri in this flick jean arthur shine when she look at powel there is an unmistak undercurr buzz between them this film may not have the wit of the thin man seri but undeni make up for it in charm while i watch it i thought for sure powel wa carri on an off screen affair with arthur my friend thought the same this is one film where i wish i could step back in time to schmooz and lock lip with powel there seem to be no end to his lovabl play smirk powel s charact lawrenc bradford is probabl the closest thing to the perfect man okay this is sound way too gushi but i can t help myself 
 
 
 
the comic banter between william powel and jean arthur is the highlight of this murder mysteri which ha one of the most bizarr and unlik plot ever powel is probabl the most suav detect of the s and arthur ha a uniqu voic which often sound like a success of tini tink bell they are extrem fun to watch so take the brash of the plot with a grain of salt and just enjoy see it unfold eric blore also ha some comic turn a powel s butler powel s contract with mgm includ a claus which allow him to reject be loan out to anoth studio but he want to work again with arthur and he like the script so he eager accept the assign they had work togeth in two paramount film the canari murder case and the green murder case both in the philo vanc seri 
 
 
 
five dead venom is not a bloodi and violent a stori of ricki or super ninja but it featur some of the best hand to hand fight sequenc in hong kong film histori director chang cheh creat what is consid by mani to be his masterpiec this movi launch the career of the five men who play the venom meng lo play yet anoth bad as he would go on to be in super ninja kuo chui who is philip kwok would go on to stori of ricki and hard boil ani chop socki fan can apperci this but i still think it ain t a good a super ninja also made by chang cheh but all chop socki is good and this is one of the veri best 
 
 
 
after read ton of good review about this movi i decid to take it for a spin i bought it on dvd henc the spin pun i m a dork the begin wa everyth i hope for a perfect set up along with some quot that i ve heard on various wu tang album to what should have been a good movi but the plot i heard wa so great wa so predict everi time i saw a charact except for the lizard i guess which venom he wa plus the onli cool charact get kill off in the middl of the movi ok so the plot wasn t veri good but at least there wa some good kung fu right wrong the fight were veri short and few and far between grant the differ style were all pretti cool but i wish the fight were longer i kept hope to see the lizard run and do some crazi ish on the wall but it never happen i wa hope to see the centiped do some tight speedi ish but it never happen i wa hope to see the scorpion in the movi for more than total minut but it never happen in short not much happen the fight is all pretti routin don t be fool just becuas this movi ha a plot it doe not mean it s a good one 
 
 
 
this movi is realli good the plot which work like puzzl forc viewer to think and guess what will happen next such a trick bring a lot of surpris and make a viewer realli look forward to solut of a riddl fight scene are veri good there s a lot of differ combat style although one of style wa a bit unreal for me but it s onli my opinion to watch and it s fascin show the onli thing which may be irrit is actor look a bit too effemin at least for me hong kong wa alway good at kung fu movi especi in the s and s so five venom or other it version is great choic

most s and s kong kong martial art film bare function a movi usual there are a few well plan fight sequenc but the plot is scrape pretti thin to fill in the gap between those node like porno film realli but this one doe sever thing well most overt there is the direct and choreographi which confin each combat to a style it s realli base on chine circus acrobat and comed theater but the effect work second there is the languag of the camera which use some impress techniqu even by today s measur chang project speed from real time time to slow motion and from unfilt to filter view to depict stori direct toward the past or toward the futur least overt but most power and unexpect is the construct the winner of this contest is determin by who unfold the stori the master the writer set up a game where the lead charact doesn t know who he s seek which is the same situat we viewer find ourselv in one by one he figur out who is who at the same rate we find out who is who it all follow a tragedi noir arc the end tend toward ironi a la the sting much more clever stuff than what we usual get out of this genr the five venom idea is the templat for tarantino s dead viper assassin from the kill bill volum

this is definit one of the best kung fu movi ever and may be one of the best movi ever it s got a great plot that function like a puzzl with lot of intrigu and suspens this film is full of cat and mous game and decept with peopl hide their ident and their natur the charact in this film live and breath much more than your averag kung fu movi charact they are all interest and compel and the movi doe a good job at give them scene to show their person s and desir the fight scene play out like littl stori and mani of them are veri origin and excit it ha cool train sequenc and martial art skill that are so awesom they enter the realm of fantasi there are member of the poison clan each one with his own style that mimic the special skill of a venom anim the style of each of these charact are fun to watch and you can see the techniqu they use in train appli dure the film when this happen the director use quick cut back to the train scene to draw a parallel these cut are accompani by music chang and sound effect and the whole thing realli work nice one thing about this movi that is veri origin is the way it treat death the director chang cheh wa obvious veri concern that the film not trivial death this make some of the scene in the movi much more effect we actual care when peopl are kill in this film this is becaus the camera linger on the horror of death even when the bad guy are kill some of the sequenc in this movi are truli gut wrench when charact go in search of vengeanc you realli feel their anger and pain at the same time this is also a fun movi it ha all the typic thing you expect from a tradit kung fu film there is bad dub the charact are will to fight at the drop of a hat some of the sound effect are hilari and at time the behavior of the charact is incred unrealist all this just add to the great of the film and let not forget that this director wa a visual stylist much more gift than most of his contemporari if you watch this movi close you will notic that the technic prowess on display is virtuost everyth goe by so fast becaus of the quick cut style and the rapid camera movement of the genr that it is easi to overlook how beauti the movi realli is the light and composit are spectacular at time the camera work and movement is extrem sophist along with veri interest fast pace edit in the scene that portray suspens and intrigu for exampl imagin hitchcock move at about twice the speed chang cheh wa truli a master craftsman and artist who knew his genr and wa abl to produc import materi while work within it s confin he doesn t rattl the boat of the kung fu genr film but in a subtl way his skill permeat everi scene and everi shot and they add great to the qualiti of the work he is an import filmmak who continu to influenc mani peopl this is the real packag a kung fu movi that deliv on everi level it s art it s trash it s emot move and it s fun it ha a true sen of moral but doesn t allow that moral to get in the way of deliv good action i recommend it to everybodi whether you are a fan of this genr or not 
 
 
 
i would give this show a ten out of ten if it wa not for the fart joke you peopl are so damn sensit it is inan so quick to point out the racism of the show and the joke yet are also so quick to say ridicul sexist pig head crap like well duh some of these other show do these joke so much better becaus at least they have hot woman so disgust abort joke are great becaus realli who take abort serious anyway at least i m not a bore son i hear that reba mcentir and sarah silverman are team up to do a movi about sister take a road trip togeth talk about a movi of the year 
 
 
 
i have to vote this out of in the rare chanc that she happen to see this review take piti on me whisk me to hollywood and involv me in her freaki funni world but in all serious it wa good first episod is obvious find it s foot but it s got that silverman weird run all the way through it it s not a laugh out loud sort of comedi but that s good thing too much ha a laughter track to it and this wouldn t be right with cue when to laugh it s to the audienc to hear their inner jester laugh at the absurd of it all i can easili see this a be the bizarro drew carey show with it s weird charact and incred strong central charact well worth a watch look forward to the follow episod a veri good chanc from the usual comedi out there p sarah call me 
 
 
 
follow a sitcom plot is so mindless easi that have her charact simultan oper both within and without the context the rest of the cast inhabit is the kind of experiment that sitcom could realli use the support charact ground the show in a sitcom realiti which provid a contextu counterpoint to sarah s errat persona which beyond general insensit ha no specif recur trait for behaviour expect to be base on make her le a charact than a canva to be repaint in everi episod if not scene sarah s abil to see everyth from an outsid perspect enabl her to parodi aspect of social behaviour that are subtl enough to usual go unnot everi time she speak it s like a self contain second skit she overemot a lot demonstr the countless thing a smile or chang in vocal pitch can signifi but never stick with one idea long enough for you to get comfort and form expect that will be satisfi this may be the most creativ origin and experiment tv program ever 
 
 
 
when i first saw this show i thought it look interest i watch it saw how it revolv around sarah like the charact see the world revolv around her i got it but wasn t laugh veri much onstag and in her show she s racist crude insensit and huge self center i didn t get her at first and took it all at face valu then i got to see her movi jesus is magic i think that serv a a sarah silverman primer for me explain to me just what languag she s speak she s like marilyn manson work so hard to give u a face of horribl idea and imag but you eventu realis it isn t an assault it s a statement and onc you understand that you find you re glad someon s final give it to you straight i don t mean to suggest onli smart peopl will understand or that to hate this show is to prove your idioci while i like a lot of smart show i still to this day do not see the humor of curb your enthusiasm i get the impress that it s good but i just don t get it mani peopl will never get the sarah silverman program but i m glad i eventu came around the creator of this show do work hard everi episod is load not just with dialogu and plot but with song or dream sequenc product number these peopl aren t put togeth someth to fill a time slot and plea advertis they appear to be on a mission to make the best show they can put togeth if i wa to predict the futur of this show i d say it will go the way of arrest develop and freak geek it will get cancel befor it s time and live on in fan heart and on dvd but take heart ssp creator your audienc is out there and we ll be watch for a long a they let you make the show 
 
 
 
big s isn t play with taboo or forc an agenda like say mencia or chapell though i like them both she state the obvious in subtl near sublimin remark her show won t chang the world nor is it meant to but along with the hilari brian posehn and paget brewster s ex boyfriend jay johnston of mr show fame this is one mean show with an appetit for destruct my side s were thorough wreck by the first episod look i love this woman and like her fame boyfriend jimmi kimmel she just deliv the line and let the viewer run with it the best kind of comedi around spoof anyth and anyon like mari poppin in the second episod when she sing to the fake bird on to quick hit commentari on societi and colleg age existenti nonsens this one is high recommend but onli for those who still have a funni bone and didn t lose it in their most recent lippo suction treatment or boob job 
 
 
 
i think this show is scream funni it s not for everi tast and i m not go to elev or denigr the folk that don t get it i m sure they re wonder bright peopl that oper at a differ wavelength but if you like it you realli like it sarah play a self infatu loser name sarah silverman who often find her self in homerian predica that s homerian a in homerian simpsonian i rememb sarah silverman from her brief gig on saturday night live in the earli s i like her immedi then and i go out of my way to check out anyth she s done this show is choke on your food and wet your pant funni therefor i alway fast befor watch it and wear adult diaper check it out 
 
 
 
i origin score sarah s show with a nice fat but i ve struggl a bit with her humor of late and a thin is what s settl in i shall explain you will either like sarah s humor or you won t if you don t i doubt anyon could persuad you you folk know who you are and it s perfect fine but then you know that too move on the first season gave u fantast bit about sarah her friend and famili and her pursuit in life in one memor episod she is pull over by offic jay whom she meet for the first time do you know whi i am stand here he ask becaus you got all c s in high school she quizzic repli it seem to be a genuin question that is funni stuff in my book sarah can come at you from odd angl in anoth episod her affair with god wa notabl funni god be petti and jealous ad wonder to the joke it is clever it is a twist view but she would show u the truth in the humor and we laugh then came the second season while still not without some new and invent comedi we seem to have slip somewhat into banal poop and fart joke quit simpli i get some good laugh here and there but much of it seem like filler while she and the writer struggl to foment some origin materi sophomor and tiresom are the feel i have for the episod late but i have been gut it out for the gem i do find the turtl and wait for her to turn it around i wa a fan of her jesus is magic routin and would like to think that i understand what she is capabl of let s get back to that 
 
 
 
this show probabl won t appeal to everyon sarah doe what she want she doesn t ask for permiss and she doesn t apolog this is a sitcom with zombi robot dinosaur fli car and a team of wallet steal male cheerlead the star of the show is not a hero she is a spoil bigot pervert if you can t appreci the offbeat humor it offer the show probabl isn t for you everyon should at least give this show a chanc it bring togeth the comed style of sarah silverman brian posehn the comedian of comedi jay johnston mr show steve age bobcat goldthwait s stay and the creativ energi of rob schrab and dan harmon heat vision jack monster hous it also showcas the best talent of the burgeon onlin communiti channel com if you re into this show keep an eye out for the depart of accept medium on vh this march it ll be draw from the same talent pool watch sarah silverman s show this kind of stuff is the futur of entertain 
 
 
 
this show is so incred hilari that i couldn t stop watch the marathon on comedi central tonight despit the fact that i ve seen all the episod previous i ve alway regard silverman a a huge talent and this is final a vehicl for that talent to be enjoy by a wide audienc i watch this show and i laugh a veri larg percentag of the time i can t say that about mani tv show can you this show is final someth new and interest and most import funni this is a show i will never miss and it is one i will buy on dvd a soon a it come out you owe it to yourself to watch this show i predict a long run for this seri and just to be clear the peopl who are offend by this show just don t get it perhap they lack the intellig to comprehend it they should stop make fool of themselv by attack someth they don t understand anyon who use the word bigot in refer to silverman or who claim that she onli aim to shock is way off the mark she s exact the opposit just googl her and you ll quick see that she s a huge propon of civil right etc if you don t know that she s iron embrac all of these outrag viewpoint you don t get it and if you don t get it do the rest of u a favor and be quiet about it so we can all enjoy the hilar 
 
 
 
all i can say is if you don t fall in love with big and littl edi after watch this movi then you re not human even after watch it for the first time i wa hook it is a mesmer experi that is difficult to describ a i m sure other fan will attest to after watch it you will cri to think that these two wonder ladi are no longer with u at least we have grey garden to rememb them i think we all long to posse the fierc independ these two ladi were grace with although i have alway admir jacki onassi kennedi she doe not stay in your heart the way big and littl edi do what a rare treat to have know such peopl i onli wish i had 
 
 
 
i realli can t rememb who recommend this but they said it wa one of their favorit film it is certain a strang one like rubberneck at a highway accid someon said that truth is stranger than fiction and the truth here is someth to see i realli can t understand how a fiction account of this documentari is to be releas this year how can you improv on this the aunt and cousin of jacki kennedi remov themselv from new york societi and hide in the hampton s in the process they becom reclus and what is best describ a crazi cat ladi they would have stay hidden had not the citi move to condemn the properti for the filth and the subsequ rescu by jacki this film wa done after that rescu all dure you couldn t help but think how bad wa it befor it s a look at high societi from the darker side and it is utter fascin 
 
 
 
one of the best love stori i have ever seen it is a bit like watch a train wreck in slow motion but love nonetheless big edi and littl edi seem a bit like famili member after watch this movi repeat and are infinit quotabl it s a goddamn beauti day now will you just shut up the open explan of littl edi s costum onli promis that the movi will live on forev and so will big edi the world famous singer and littl edi the world famous dancer 
 
 
 
it s interest how the train of research can flow i start out look at an articl about cristo s the gate in central park the articl state that the maysl had been cristo s filmograph for year hmmm then i got to look at their bodi of work i believ one of them ha pas on but the other is still film cristo and jean claud in their stage of creation grey garden sound veri interest video station in boulder co is the place to look for the obscur or offbeat and of cours they had it in stock dvd and vhs edith and edi are woman live in the past and oh what a glorious past it wa edith had been well off born a bouvier marri well had sever wonder relationship and becam a singer when she wa in her forti her daughter edi had been a d butant a fashion model and had mani beau she never marri and at some point in her thirti had come home to recuper she seem to have a nervous disord of some kind worri too much about thing it is onli a shadow of the world they live in though becaus jacki o came and spruce up the place so her aunt and cousin would not be evict it is a room mansion that is worn down and worn out but in the film you will notic fresh paint on the wall if you look care at the newspap clip you see it wa veri much a dirti mess the outfit edi come up with a veri clever and creativ the viewer get the impress that edith like to go nude but she doesn t in the movi edith wa realli quit beauti and you can see the shadow of her beauti still a she sing tea for two edi too wa a beauti in her day and quit attract at it wa a good movi though not for everyon when the cat is urin behind edith s portait she state at least someon is do what they want 
 
 
 
i find it veri intrigu that lee radziwil jacki kennedi s sister and the cousin of these woman would encourag the maysl to make big edi and littl edi the subject of a film they certain could be consid the skeleton in the famili closet the extra featur on the dvd includ sever contemporari fashion design credit some of their idea to these oddbal woman i d say that anyon interest in fashion would find the discus by these design fascin i e are they nut or am i miss someth this movi is hard to come by netflix doe not have it facet doe though 
 
 
 
littl edi and big edi are charact that anyon can feel compass for even though their hous wa filthi this is somehow understand consid their mental ill on the messag board a poster wrote that littl edi ha the cope skill of an eight year old this remind me of when in the dramat version big edi say to littl edi if you re stuck it s onli with yourself these woman had everyth beauti talent intellig firm belief in their opinion and action perhap if littl edi wasn t so hard on herself the first time thing didn t work out lose her hair her job and the love of her life she would have made it this somehow tie into what i believ is her mental ill her inabl to pick herself up when time are hard and see that good time lie ahead the world will never know what have happen if she didn t listen to her mom s plea come home edi let me take care of you yet these understand insecur woman somehow manag to be brilliant heartbreak and lovabl even in their extrem filthi home these woman were extraordinari and their interact with each other bring humor and sad when edi had one of her emot breakdown dwell about what could have been or about how she want to get out of her home becaus she feel like a littl girl one get the intens urg to hug her and tell her that everyth will be okay great documentari 
 
 
 
grey garden is shock amus sad and mesmer i watch in amaz a edith jr and sr bicker and perform while reminisc of their past their exist in a dilapid mansion which they had not left for more than fifteen year is both a comedi and a tragedi this is a film you will not soon forget 
 
 
 
excel film show the pathet live of two nutti old ladi they couldn t live togeth nor apart babbl constant sometim at the same time they hash and re hash the past go on and on about what coulda shoulda woulda i found myself laugh at time but most i wa taken with how utter sad and abandon these two woman were see this one 
 
 
 
i took this out arbitrarili from the librari the other night have no idea of the film s cult influenc or that it is current be stage a a music most of the comment here are on target it s move funni sad and yes a tad exploit despit the best intent of the filmmak the expand chriterion edit is a must for anyon who love it when it came out i think you can also see in littl edi the fall of a class that sort of disappear you can hear it in old film of jacki o too peopl just don t talk like that anymor i think a a documentari it would have been interest to get more inform about how the home fell into disreput old edi at least still seem awar of what s go on to a certain degre couldn t she see the onc spectacular home disintegr yet the film s subject is the life the two woman have construct for themselv now a real life tenness william one act well worth your time 
 
 
 
i saw this film a coupl of week ago and it s been stuck in my head ever sinc it star two spellbind charact in what is unfortun a mediocr documentari to get the true stori of the beal i had to wade through all of the dvd s bonus materi and commentari and search the web although the maysl and their fan not to mention edith and edi themselv bristl at the suggest that this film is exploit this is exploit in the truest sen of the word veri littl effort is everi made to explain the beal or how they came to the condit they were in the maysl approach seem to be to just turn the camera on and wait for edith and edi to say someth outrag the sound even on the criterion re releas is poor and difficult to follow although i appreci this film wa made somewhat earli in the histori of documentari film it s iron to compar it to geraldo rivera s far superior seri on the sexual abus of mental retard patient at willowbrook state school in staten island from four year befor grey garden wa shot to paraphras a review in the new yorker there were mani thing edith and edi need in their live and a documentari wasn t one of them a for edith and edi the thing i kept think while watch the film wa where the hell is their famili they were live in danger unhealthi unsaf condit how is it that jacki o marri to one of the richest men on earth or the wealthi bouvier famili themselv couldn t afford to get edith and edi a decent home or at the veri least hire a part time housekeep or caregiv to come in and keep an eye on them both it s shame and a last disgrac to the entir bouvier famili although this review may sound negat i would strong recommend grey garden to anyon who enjoy documentari perhap someday someon will come along and do a documentari about this documentari bring in the rich backstori and afterstori of the beal and the whole subsect of hampton societi in the s 
 
 
 
i found grey garden s to be a grip film an amaz intim look at too eccentr who basic have the right idea forget societi and live in a delapid hous with no heat and a huge brood of cat and raccoon persu their own interest rather mundain all the while chatter at the camera big edi and littl edi are the two crazi that the mazl bros have chosen to document they seem like charact out of a fellini film onli stranger if that make ani sen old edi is almost fulli bedridden a pile of paper cloth and dirti dish grow around her littl edi is even more interest she pranc around the hous alway wear a baboushka like headdress around her head complet cover her hair we never see her hair throughout the film nor do we ever get a hint that she still ha much at age fifti eight though she is still beauti and full of life in grey garden we get the sen that both of these woman s live have becom much le than what they onc were littl edi is probabl the sadder of the two while her mother in her earlier year got marri made a famili live luxuri and even made some record the scene where at she sing along with a record of tea for two she made decad ago is one of the film best scene edi left her promic career a a model to take care of her ail mother at she still long to find her princ charm if anyth littl edi is still a littl girl full of dream of glamour and fame and of domest and romant bliss that have yet to be fulfil highlight of the film includ the open moment where littl edi explain her outfit to the camera the tea for two sequenc the birthday parti the climact argument the groceri deliv scene and the scene in the attic the whole thing is incred candid and unpretenci and it s made all the more remarc sinc it s all real i suggest see grey garden back to back with the kenneth anger short puce moment the criterion dvd is but it s worth everi penni 
 
 
 
 grey garden is the maysl brother bizarr documentari of jacki bouvier kennedi onassi eccentr aunt and first cousin who live like pig in a run down room mansion on east hampton long island big edi bouvier beal witti and dri and her daughter littl edi beal emot about a still beauti woman who onc had a promis futur live in isol from the rest of the world except for their mani cat and raccoon in the attic they amus themselv by bicker all day listen to the radio or sing to each other they dont even own a televis their fall from societi is amaz to learn of and the viewer is drawn to these two veri special although obvious dysfunct peopl one of the better documentari ever made and still a cult classic today

there wa a stylish approach to this film on the part of director vincenzo natali with interest camera angl and effect close up it wa also refresh to see jeremi northam and luci liu given lead role and expand their rang a perform this film also includ one of the most imagin escap scene in recent year the effort of the director and the actor combin in an effect thriller although the plot of the film wa convolut the stori progress veri clear a the layer of corpor greed and skullduggeri were reveal in georg orwel suggest in his famous novel that the futur would be rule by the totalitarian state which would control mind and diminish human liberti it wa interest that in this intrigu futurist film it wa not the state but rather the corpor world that control and devalu the human worker

wa this base on a comic book a video game a draw by a year old there is noth in this movi to be taken serious at all not the charact not the dialog not the plot not the action noth we have high tech intern terrorist crimin who bicker like pre school kid stallon s man of steel type resili toward ice cold weather dialog so dumb that it s sometim almost hilari and so on even the codenam that the bad guy use is dumb tango tango a film that entertain through some suspens good action sequenc and a nice snowi mountain set oh yes and the unintent humour the film open with some truli bad and unconvinc gay banter between our go lucki and happi charact who are obvious have a swell time then come a sweat induc fail rescu part which should make anyon with fear of height problem want to pull their hair out and then we have some more bad dialog and after that some more great action this is the rhythm of the film in a nutshel stallon s melodramat exchang with turner when they meet after a long time is so soapi so clich d so fake and so bad that it should forc a chuckl out of ani self respect viewer soon after this display of aw dialog write we are wit to a spectacular and excel shot hijack of an airplan the entir action is one big absurd but it s mindless fun at it best although the rest of the action is excit and fun the airplan scene are truli the highlight of the film after the land our master crimin seek for a guid and end up with stallon and rooker they send stallon to fetch the first case of money but somehow they do everyth to make it a difficult a possibl for him to reach it they take most of his cloth off so he can freez and they won t give him the equip he need so he can fall off do these gangster want their money fetch or not veri silli appar they don t trust stallon but sure they know that they can alway black mail him by use rooker a a hostag nevertheless our gangster make stallon s climb difficult if for no logic reason then to at least show u how truli evil they are lest there be ani doubt and for those who might still doubt how evil the bad guy are they overact brag and snicker in a truli evil manner everyon convinc good you d better be otherwis the writer will throw in a mass execut of twenti school child just to make sure that the evil of the bad guy is crystal clear to everyon the old guy who fli the chopper how the hell did he fall for the trap first he must have been warn by the mtv airhead about the crimin and second he must have heard stallon s and rooker s voic on the walki talki a whole bunch of idiot verbal exchang take place with lithgow have the question honour of get most of the silli line get off my back lithgow i haven t even start climb on your back or lithgow to stallon we had a deal but now we onli have each other and a for lithgow s gang of murder these guy never seem to want to kill immedi they are veri creativ about it they philosoph pretend that they are play footbal with your bodi and so on stallon co wrote this thing i have no idea what drug he wa on when he did it i d hate to think the script is this bad becaus of a low i q 
 
 
 
sinc i first saw this in the theater it ha been my favorit sinc then i ve seen it countless time and i never get tire of it the set ha a lot to do with it the colorado i know would be jealous but the storylin is origin and i like how it use small town mountain folk a the hero there ha not been a movi i can compar this too john lithgow play a smart villain but i love how he is complet out of his element he ha to follow tucker around and that s what keep it interest this is an action movi at it s best i don t think i ll see anoth that is so entertain you don t need round fire to qualifi a an action movi it just ha to keep you captiv not shell shock 
 
 
 
to be honest i didn t like that much this movi when i saw it for the first time but i guess the troubl is that i haven t seen it in a theater big mistak becaus the thing to see in cliffhang is the set and is the cinematographi tri to see this movi on the largest tv possibl and a great sound system the music is good and put the movi to a higher level and a commerci potenti the more i see it the more i like it it s definit one of renni harlin s best movi this guy know about action die hard the long kiss good bye etc and it s particular good in this movi the special effect are great and spectacular stallon realli need that movi get back with success still good to see him

i will start by say that this ha undeserv be pan by just about everyon the fact is it wasn t what anyon wa expect especi from guy ritchi what everyon wa expect wa cockney geezer and good one liner do ya like dag etc but this is far more matur than his previous work i would agre that it is confus but all the fact are there for u we just have to see them and listen harder this film demand all your attent look past the cool and dazzl look of the film tri to listen to the dialogu rather than admir the perform and i think we will all get a more thorough understand of the whole film yes this ha it influenc from modern classic fight club pulp fiction etc but it is in the whole origin in both direct and pace with a music score second to none i feel that if everyon watch this film over and over they would understand it a lot more and mayb appreci it for the fine piec of modern cinema that it is and i hope also that ritchi continu in this vain a i far prefer this to his mockney masterpiec

first of all when peopl hear guy ritchi they immedi think of snatch yes snatch wa a good movi but the problem is that everyon associ guy ritchi to snatch they don t expect him to explor new frontier this movi revolv is differ than snatch it s much darker and is veri complex the reason i gave a rate of is becaus i ve had to watch revolv time to understand everyth so this movi toy with your head it s veri clever written this movi is differ than snatch it wa done wonder the cinematographi is beauti and you can recogn guy ritchi s person touch style of direct in it what won me over wa the complex of the protagonist and how we are left with more question than answer

i recommend famili if possibl to show this to older child onli some of the stuff in this film mayb too disturb for littl one to handl now that that out of the way let me explain about this movi this is in realiti a documentari of a male fox who in the begin is protect his territori and seek a mate the begin with the gorgeous sunris and music score is breath take you had better soak in a much of the sceneri a possibl it ll get ugli later they gave both the fox and the vixen name but i can t rememb what they are for the like of me he fight off this invad male to win her love they later on creat a den and the vixen give birth to four ador cub one of which is blind there are mani happi and play moment featur the fox famili but tragedi and bad luck strike all too soon the first victim is the blind pup who get too close to a high tide and is wash away the second victim is the mother who while steal chicken is deceiv by a dead chicken hang on a pole she unknow walk into a foot trap while tri to escap she rip off part of her foot caus her to bleed to death the rest of the fox famili is forc to watch her die under a tree the male is now a singl dad forc to take on the roll of mom and dad he alon ha to teach them the skill they need for life it later prove not to be enough when two of the now grown pup meet an ugli fate of their own thank to the careless and crueliti of man i won t spoil the surpris end for you but it doe show the farmer and his dog close on his tail and it is a well deserv end after what the audienc and the fox famili wa put through i want to say that i saw this when it first came out in earli s when we had a thing call showbiz cabl i wa onli when i saw it but i could never understand whi they wouldn t let me see all of it now i know whi after i secret watch it when it came on disney when i wa i felt emot gut after see all this evil go on i wa move to tear but a dark and ugli a it wa it serv a purpos to let peopl what is go to these and other kind of anim and whi they are endang this documentari want to get the messag across about this endang speci and i hope it work it not fake like the true life natur film by disney they don t teach about whi anim are go extinct the encroach of land the kill off of the fox main prey and senseless kill of these beauti anim ha result in them becom endang i wish they would make sequel to this movi glacier fox to see if they re be treat better mayb have it be about a vixen pup name teresa and her sibl grow up this movi also kind of reflect what happen to human famili sometim especi when one of the parent sudden die the surviv parent take on the roll of both and tri to teach the import lesson of life it isn t alway enough to protect them when they re adult especi when some of their live becom ruin or they fall victim to tragedi themselv best all around soundtrack and music score i ve ever heard 
 
 
 
the villian in this movi is one mean sob and he seem to enjoy what he is do that is what i guess make him so mean i don t think most men will like this movi especi if they ever cheat on their wife this is one of those movi that pretti much stay pretti mean to the veri end but then there you have it a candi bar end that make me look back and say hoki a hell a pretti good movi until the end end is the end we would like to see but not the end to such a mean begin and then there is the aftermath of what happen guess you can make up your own mind about the true end i m left feel that onli one charact should have surviv at the end 
 
 
 
some of the acknowledg altman masterpiec seem sadder to me now mayb it s me like the last review i even like this lesser altman shown recent on fmc although i don t think he wa aim at a wide audienc organ polit a a microcosm for public campaign some of this satir docudrama is now date like dick cavett watch the tonight show but i found much of the dialog funni and insight e g you are for real that mean you re no threat to anyon the stori isn t profound but i like it and the perform are funni especi cavett a himself lauren bacal a an age conserv figurehead glenda jackson who actual becam a member of parliament a a left wing ideologu in the open scene lectur someon dress a a carrot on the sanctiti of polit and carol burnett a a basket case all in the inimit altman style although mayb not quit a inimit a usual but pretti inimit

 pick up never got the respect it should have it work on mani level and ha a complic but follow plot the actor involv give some of their finest perform ann margret roy scheider and john glover are perfect cast and provid deep charact portray notabl too are vaniti who should have parlay this into a serious act career given the unexpect abil she show and kelli preston who s charact will haunt you for a few day anyon who like action combin with a gritti complic stori will enjoy this 
 
 
 
this is a great small film i say small becaus it doesn t have a hundr gun fire or a dozen explos a in a john woo film great perform by roy scheider and the three bad guy john frankenheim seem to have more luck with small product these day the film is veri easi to watch the stori is more of a yarn than a wash machin instead of everyth go around and around it seem a though thing just get wors a the plot thicken wonder end veri posit i never read the elmor leonard book but it can t be much differ from the film becaus it feel like i m watch an elmor leonard movi 
 
 
 
this slick and gritti film consist deliv it s one of frankenheim s best and most underr film and it s easili the best elmor leonard adapt to date and if you are scratch your head think but i love get shorti you need to be punch in the face in my opinion no one captur the feel for leonard s charact better then john glover in pick up the reloc of the stori from detroit novel to hollywood film elev the stori s sleaz factor to amaz height be a man have a few beer and watch this movi for refer purpos my favorit leonard book are swag rum punch cat chaser citi primev and pick up my favorit frankenheim film includ second and the manchurian candid i also have a real special place in my cold movi heart for dead bang and black sunday

chase ha creat a true phenomenon with the soprano unfalt perform rock solid write and some great music make up what ha becom quit possibl the best show ever all of the cast are strong but falco and gandolfini earn everi inch of those emmi s anyon who doubt this need onli sampl a few episod particular from the first few season jame gandolfini is absolut fierc absolut terrifi and you still find yourself love him mesmer by him mani peopl that i ve spoken to about the soprano who haven t seen it yet will say i m just not a fan of mafia movi show whatev run don t walk and get it those same peopl usual love e r but i bet they don t much care for hospit it s not about the context 
 
 
 
this is the definit lar von trier movi my favorit i rank it higher than break the wave or the latest dancer in the dark i simpli love the beauti of the pictur the frame is so origin act is wonder a must see 
 
 
 
the soprano wa probabl the last best show to air in the s it sad that it over it wa the best show on hbo if not on tv not everyth wa spell out for you throughout you had to think it wa brilliant the cast wa excel toni jame gandolphini is a great actor and play his charact excel a well a the other each charact had flaw that what made them so real and allow the viewer to connect with them and that one reason it last so long the last episod wa good i m not sure how to take it mani differ thing can be constru by the end id like to think that toni didn t die but meadow walk in and sat down with them and that the blackout wa just for suspens toni will have to go to trial and deal with that hope is not dead that how i feel long live the soprano and toni soprano 
 
 
 
now i have read some negat review for this show on this websit and quit frank i m appal for anyon to even think that the soprano is not televis then i m afraid i don t know what the world ha come to let me tell u someth i start watch mani t v show like lost prison break dexter deadwood and even invas but all of those show lost their touch after the first season especi lost and prison break which i refus to watch becaus the compani took genius idea and butcher them by make more than one season then we have the soprano i can honest say that this is the onli televis seri that i have ever watch where i have been enthral in all of it season and more import all of it episod there is no depart that this show doesn t excel in act noth short of superb jame gandolfini is one of my favourit actor and i feel that his act is absolut stun in everi episod after i heard that hbo want ray liotta to play toni i felt that it would ve been the better choic howev after watch the first few episod i knew that hbo had done a great job in cast jame a toni the raw emot he display is superb then we have everyon el edi falco michael imperioli lorrain bracco domin chianes whom i rememb a johnni ola in the godfath part and my person two favourit charact toni sirico and steve van zandt pauli walnut gualtieri and silvio dant all of these actor perform to the best qualiti and all give an excel perform in each episod then we have the stori never have i been so suck into a t v show befor the stori is noth short of excel each episod is direct superbl and the score of this show is just fantast i feel that the soprano is one show that i can watch again and again and never get bore of it got everyth from hilari humour to brutal violenc but nonetheless it is and will alway be the best thing to ever grace the televis and i challeng anyon to find a real flaw in the show not just say it too violent or they feel that the charact of toni is immor i mean it is a mafia show at the end of the day i don t think that the charact are go to be veri honest or loyal to god i implor everyon to watch this show becaus believ me you ll be hook from the veri first episod i wa and i have even gotten a few friend who had first refus to watch the show hook on it trust me when i say that this show is a godsend compar to the crap that come on t v after you ve watch the first season you ll inevit agre with me when i onc again say that this show domin televis and no t v show current or futur will ever upstag the marvel that is the soprano 
 
 
 
 the godfath of televis but asid from it s acclaim and mobster charact the two are noth alik toni soprano is forc to go to a psychiatrist after a seri of panic attack his psychiatrist learn that toni is actual part of two famili in one famili he is a love father yet not so perfect husband and in the other famili he is a ruthless wiseguy after analysi dr melfi conclud that toni s problem actual deriv from his mother livia who s suspect to have borderlin person disord gandolfini is right prais a the main charact yet bracco and marchand aren t near a recogn for their equal and talent perform a the psychiatrist and mother respect falco imperioli and dematteo are acclaim for their brilliant support role van zandt from the e street band play his first and onli role a toni s best friend and is quit convinc and latch chianes the onli recur actor to have actual appear in a godfath film play toni s uncl and on and off nemesi mani fan also enjoy charact play by pastor ventimiglia curatola proval pantoliano lip sciorra and buscemi toni s child are okay but not notabl with the except of iler s stun perform in the third to last episod the second come sirico and schirripa are unconvinc and over the top but the show is too strong for them to hold it back even a the show continu for over six season it ceas to have a dull or predict moment out of four 
 
 
 
the soprano is probabl the most wide acclaim tv seri ever so natur my expect were through the roof and yet the show surpass them i love the mafia and crime genr in film and i enjoy follow the compel stori set in these world but this is so much more hour of materi give the stori a chanc to not onli be one of the most thrill and unpredict mafia action stori but also to be a great famili drama a shock charact studi a laugh out loud comedi a brilliant psycholog examin deal with the natur of good and evil and an intellectu arti collabor of repres dream and hallucin all in one david chase s epic seri manag to accomplish all of this and more and cement hbo a the closest tv can get to cinemat perfect pave the road for a number of other seri to continu blow audienc away realism is present when it is need but chase s decis to depart from it for effect on occas for dream episod and the like onli add more layer to the seri chase along with a strong write staff includ matthew weiner and terrenc winter futur creator of mad men and boardwalk empir respect turn new jersey into an intric univers full of the greatest cast of charact i ve seen on tv jame gandolfini domin the show a toni one of the most groundbreak charact on tv ever toni adher to half of the mobster stereotyp from pop cultur but he defi the other half entir and through his famili interact and his therapi session with dr melfi lorrain bracco with whom he ha a consider chemistri that ensur that the therapi scene alway have a complet differ feel to the rest of the show we see near everi side to toni soprano and learn that he is more of an everyman than one would expect edi falco match the power of gandolfini s perform a toni s wife carmela from her mix feel about toni s lifestyl to her suspicion about murder to her torment over toni s cheat to her own thought about infidel carmela run the gamut of emot throughout season and falco make her the prime vehicl for the non mafia viewer to have eye into such a corrupt world scene between toni and carmela provid some of the most heartwrench and pain realist drama ever seen on televis the support cast is almost a phenomen and a wide array of charact popul the cast over all six season somehow without ani redund nanci marchand steal the show a toni s overbear mother livia an insight into toni s person problem and panic attack the familiar of marchand s incess complaint is almost gruesom sinc she take the charact so believ far michael imperioli is christoph toni s prot g whose various poor choic lead him down a road that is pain to watch but brilliant execut drea de matteo play christoph s girlfriend adriana and is so well mean and love that the dark arc her charact take a she get too involv with christoph s career toni sirico is pauli introduc a the ultim mafia stereotyp and a sourc of comic but eventu he becom one of the most sympathet and complex charact on the show and nobodi play true anger better than he and that s just the tip of the iceberg familiar face such a peter bogdanovich jon favreau ben kingsley lauren bacal will arnett nanci sinatra david strathairn robert patrick hal holbrook burt young and eric mangini make appear over the cours of the show while name a notabl a joe pantoliano steve buscemi and steven van zandt have regular role a main charact in the seri there are great charact with power arc and the excit and tension never let up in ani of the various subplot throughout the show comed element and entir episod fill with brilliant hilar dilut the powerhous dramat intens of the seri which is so multipurpos that for one reason or enough the credit of near ani episod left me somewhat bewild the soprano is the most power and addict seri i have seen overal and it high are so mindblow that i would have to call it my favourit show in spite of arguabl low most of which i disagre with whether you love or hate the end or what you make of it is irrelev the discus it ha creat is an achiev in itself the icon natur of the entir seri make it an essenti part of televis histori there are multipl element for anyon to love and marvel at in this show so if you re think of watch someth el instead do yourself a favour and fuhgeddaboutit 
 
 
 
the soprano is perhap the most mind open seri you could possibl ever want to watch it s smart it s quirki it s funni and it carri the mafia genr so well that most peopl can t resist watch the best aspect of this show is the overwhelm realism of the charact set in the subterranean world of the new york crime famili for most of the time you realli don t know whether the wise guy will stab someon in the back or buy them lunch further ad to the realist approach of the charact in this show is the depth of their person these are danger men most of them murder but by god if you don t love them too i ve laugh at their wisecrack been torn when they ve made err in judgement and felt scare at the sheer ruthless of a serious crimin the suburban set of new jersey is absolut perfect for this show s subtext peopl aren t alway a they seem and the stark contrast between humdrum and the action taken by these seem petti crimin weigh up to even the odd if you haven t alreadi you most definit should 
 
 
 
take a pinch of goodfella mix it with the godfath add some roman mytholog and plenti of lowbrow comedi and you have the soprano about a mob clan oper out of northern new jersey it s almost a entertain a pro wrestl i am not the biggest fan of this show but i do admir jame gandolfini s veri complic toni soprano a psychopath with an occasion glimmer of conscienc i also have come to admir te contribut of folk like gravel voic dom chianes a the bewild but murder uncl junior silver hair toni sirico a the perpetu perplex pauli and the veri beauti edi falco a the duplicit tough a nail carmela soprano the violenc is sudden and graphic the bodi count steadili climb each season but it is often the small moment that matter most here watch pauli and toni s nephew christoph michael imperioli late of law order a they get lost in the pine barren and sit out a bitter cold night in an abandon trruck both convinc they ve had it 
 
 
 
i ve onli watch the first seri on dvd but would summaris the soprano a a shakespearean plot with a tarantino like script the seri is a good a goodfella and casino and almost a good a the godfath henc not a and far better than ani of guy ritchi s effort although there s plenti of action some of it pretti bloodi the stori is charact driven even some of the minor charact contribut to great stori line e g the priest s relationship or lack of with carmilla and the restaurateur s wife and christoph and his dimwit friend who didn t last veri long a darwin award nomine apart from the plot the script and the act the other reason i like it it made me want to visit new jersey and eat pasta with a tomatoey sauc the music it show that liter anyon can suffer from mental health problem 
 
 
 
i believ that the soprano is an awesom show becaus of all the support charact in it i have bought everi video so far and am wait for the rest to be releas in all episod so far the best one is definit episod denial anger accept this episod deal with my most favorit charact of all time in the soprano his name wa brendan filon he wa kill for hijack the wrong truck and accident kill a truck driver brendan wa awesom becaus he wa actual one of the few charact who actual stood against toni and his gang in the end he end up get shot through the eye while take a bath and that s my most favorit scene ever in the histori of the soprano brendan filon is for me and my most favorit charact ever wa matthew bevilaqua who wa kill after attempt to murder christoph moltisanti toni and pussi shoot him in hucklebarney park after they catch and tortur him my most favorit charact is sean gismont who wa kill right after shoot christoph and final my most favorit charact is chucki signor one of uncl junior s henchman he wa kill on a boat by toni all the awesom charact are dead that s the onli bad thing about the soprano all the cool guy alway get kill you know what would be great to chang about the soprano they should have a whole episod where they show all the dead support charact in hell and they are all tri to tortur chris toni uncl junior silvio and pauli becaus they need to get their reveng brendan filon shall strike back 
 
 
 
not onli do the storylin in the soprano engag audienc from all over but i think for me at least what bring the viewer back is the act not even you gari can disput that claim jame gandolfini who play the lead man toni soprano ha becom in this viewer s opinion one of the hollywood elit a far a act in a televis seri goe i wouldn t go ahead and compar him with robert deniro or al pacino or at least not just yet he howev doe do a hell of a job play the part of toni soprano in the year sinc gandolfini ha risen so much so a an actor main thank to his role in the soprano that today he is consid to be among the best in the busi and it s not just him the soprano field a great support cast includ that of lorrain bracco edi falco michael imperioli domin chianes and the late nanci marchand who play toni s dread mother at this point in the show s exist it s be consid a cult classic and right so the first two season were extraordinari violent and quit gruesom in a pretti frequent manner but without a doubt extraordinarili done the third season wa great but didn t quit live up to the hype of season and season which wrap up right befor new year wa the weakest season yet or at least in my opinion it wa despit a dri spell i still found it season of the soprano to be more entertain than most of it competit and that s say a lot becaus late i ve been notic a trend in good new televis show exampl of this six foot under the shield curb your enthusiasm and oz which is not technic a new show but end with an unforgett final season this year to get back to my point though to consid a show better than all the competit dure a particular bad year no le is quit an accomplish on the part of the writer the soprano rank abov and beyond all other televis show in it era and it writer deserv a lot of credit to close i d like to say the soprano is the real deal folk for the averag matur viewer and abov who enjoy drama and doesn t mind a mix of a littl violenc and profan you might want to check out the soprano if you get the chanc trust me in that it will be well worth the time 
 
 
 
there are so mani reason a to whi i rate the soprano so high one of it biggest triumph be the cast and charact build each charact unfold more and more each seri also each seri ha an array of differ small time charact a well a the main a good exampl of a charact who wa onli in three episod who you can feel for is david the compuls gambler play brilliant by robert patrick everi littl detail build the perfect tv seri the show revolv round mob bos toni soprano jame gandolfini who attempt to balanc his life of crime with his role a father of two the show is not afraid to be bold and power with it dialogu and imageri and this is what make it so believ whilst toni run thing with capo pauli toni sirico and silvio steve van zant his nephew christoph michael imperioli look for a promot everi episod also featur toni s other famili in some way which includ his child and wife carmela soprano edi falco on top of these problem is his uncl junior soprano domin chianes is tri to get what he can out of toni s busi despit be under hous arrest all the act is power and charact complex but the two who stand out the most are jame gandolfini who is toni soprano also michael imperioli who play christoph repres the younger generat in crime if david chase had not creat this masterpiec modern tv drama of such calib may not have exist such a the wire and dexter so the soprano is definit the godfath goodfella and pulp fiction of tv
 
 
 
this is not so bad that it is good it is pure good for those who don t understand whi you have the intellect of a four year old in respons to a certain comment anyway killer tomato eat franc is a parodi of itself a parodi of you and a parodi of me it is the singl most genius text in cinemat histori i have it and the three prequel sit on my dvd rack next to herzog and kurosawa it embodi the recognit of absurd and undermin all that you or me call standard i write script and this movi singl hand open up a genr of comedi for me the like of which we have never seen it can onli be taken in portion it sort of exploit by now i m just tri to take up the ten line minimum my comment end a while ago hope it work when i submit it now 
 
 
 
wow i love the whole seri and am shock at comment by peopl who thought it end bad perhap it waffl a bit in season while remain better than anyth el on televis but and particular b were beauti permut on the theme develop in the more muscular first three season b start with such a sombr mood and janic s alway keen insight into the famili angst that doom fill line about know toni s penchant for sit and stare anyon who miss the implic of that for the rest of the seri doe not know toni melfi s discomfort over the psychiatr studi and it refer to the sociopath s self delud sentiment for pet and anim goe back to the first episod of the seri say with toni s panic attack over the duck leav his pool and reson with phil s wave bye bye line to his grandchild befor the coup de grace of the final episod not to get into chase s dark humour i could go on and on but i ll just add that i thought the final show start with the open strain of vanilla fudg to suppli the iron foreshadow you keep me hangin on to the termin moment where toni fade back into complac with his famili in tow or blast apart like aj s suv or phil s head were utter utter perfect the best tv ever pretti good in a die medium patholog suppli the jack off fantasi aj derid and then into which he prompt subsid a tip of the pork pie to mr chase 
 
 
 
what can you possibl say about a show of this magnitud the soprano ha liter redefin televis a we know it it ha broken all rule and set new standard for televis excel everyth is flawless the write direct and for me most of all the act watch this show you ll find yourself realiz that these charact are not real the act trick you into think there is a real toni soprano or ani charact this show is also veri versatil some peopl don t watch the show becaus it s violent it s not all about the violenc it s about busi famili and mani deeper thing that all depend on what you a a fan see for me i don t like when peopl refer to the show a show about the mafia for me it s a show about famili a famili who through generat happen to be apart of the mob overal this is a masterpiec of a show this is what televis should be right here complex charact from stun act magnific stori line from brilliant write and what do you get when you mix these ingredi togeth a show that defin excel and dare to be differ 
 
 
 
the soprano is arguabl the greatest show in dramat televis histori it hard to think of anoth seri that boast so much intellig sublim write or first rate perform across it epic scope it produc fresh and icon charact and a constant level of high qualiti center around the life of one toni soprano a man who live in two famili one is the convent wife and two kid nuclear famili the other a huge new jersey mafia group of which he is the bos of both play by jame gandolfini of true romanc and the mexican fame toni is a fascin scari but also likabl guy full prais must be given to gandolfini for make a womanis and horrif aggress brute a genuin identifi and perfect lead man contemporay american drama ha never had such an arrest and icon figur a toni the cast of hundr never boast a flat perform and such stand out charact like pauli walnut and ralph cifaretto will stick in your memori for ever the true genius of this tale howev is the creator and writer braveri and revolutionari take on a convent drama seri twenti minut long dream sequenc power and origin use of symbol and metaphor imageri and truli shock scene of violenc yet all this style is met by truli touch theme of love honour and respect for famili the seri never becom cold heart or gratuit with tv now competit and often poor the soprano stand tall abov the rest a america s most origin and compel drama forget famili redifin this is televis redifin 
 
 
 
i love midnight cowboy and have it in my video collect a it is a favorit of mine what is interest to me is how when midnight cowboy came out in it wa so shock to viewer that it wa rate x of cours at that time x meant matur sinc i wa onli two year old at the time of the movi s releas it is hard for me to imagin just how shock viewer were back then howev when i tri to take into account that mani of the topic cover in the film which includ prostitut the titl itself wa slang for a male prostitut homosexu loneli physic and to some extent emot a well abus and drug are hard for mani peopl to talk about to this day i can begin to get a sen of what viewer of this movi thought back on it releas it is worth note that in the s midnight cowboy wa downgrad to an r rate and even though it is still rate r some of the scene could almost be rate pg by today s standard i want to briefli give a synopsi of the plot although it is probabl known to almost anyon who ha heard of the movi jon voight play a young man name joe buck from texa who decid that he can make it big a a male hustler in new york citi escort rich woman he emul cowboy actor like roy roger by wear a cowboy outfit think that that will impress woman after be reject by all the woman he ha come across he meet a sleazi con man name enrico ratso rizzo who is play by dustin hoffman ratso convinc joe that he can make all kind of money if he ha a manag onc again joe is con and befor long is homeless howev joe come across ratso and is invit to stay in a dilapid apart without give away much more of the plot i want to say that the remaind of the movi deal with joe and ratso a they tri to help one anoth in an attempt to fulfil their dream i e joe make it a a gigolo and ratso go down to florida where he think he can regain his health i want to make some comment about the movi itself first of all the act is excel especi the lead although the movi is realli veri sad from the begin to the end there are some classic scene in fact there are some scene that while they are not intend to be funni i find them amus for exampl there is the classic scene where dustin hoffman and jon voight are walk down a citi street and a cab practic run them over dustin hoffman bang on the cab and say hey i m walkin here i m walkin here i get a kick out of that scene becaus it is so typic of new york citi where so mani peopl are in a hurri anoth scene that come to mind is the scene where ratso dustin hoffman send joe jon voight to a guy name o daniel what is amus is that at first we think o daniel is there to recruit gigolo and can see whi joe is get so excit but then we begin to realiz that o daniel is noth but a religi nut in addit to the two scene i mention i love the scene where ratso and joe are argu in their apart when ratso say to joe that his cowboy outfit onli attract homosexu and joe say in self defens john wayn you gonna tell me he s a fag what i like is the deliveri in that scene i would say that even though midnight cowboy wa set in the late s much of it ring true today that s becaus although the area around nd street in new york ha been clean up in the form of disneyf in the last sever year homeless is still just a preval there now a it wa year ago also mani peopl have unrealist dream of how they are go to strike it big onli to have their dream smash a wa the case with the jon voight charact one thing that impress me about jon voight s charact is how he is a survivor and i felt that at the end of the movi he had matur a great deal and that ratso dustin hoffman s charact wa a good influenc on him in conclus i want to say that i suggest that when watch this movi one should watch it at least a coupl of time becaus there are so mani thing that go on for exampl there are a bunch of flashback and dream sequenc that made more sen to me after a coupl of view also what i find interest is that there is a lot in this movi that is left to interpret such a what realli happen with joe buck jon voight s charact and the peopl who were in his life in texa even the end while i don t want to give it away for those who have not seen the movi is rather open end 
 
 
 
first i would like to say how great this it is astound and sometim shock and to say the least i m year old and this is my favorit movi i can definit stand a bore film but this is anyth but bore it is like a trip through human it stark realism show through this monument masterpiec it is a heart wrench tale of two down and outer voight and hoffman who build a mutual friendship joe buck voight a naiv texan stud come to new york to make it rich by entertain woman soon he meet rico ratso rizzo hoffman who is a poor man bare be abl to pay rent ratso becom joe s manag but soon both men can t find joe a job which result in steal food a they tri and surviv on the street of new york we realiz how tough it is they can t get joe a girl until they meet a ladi at a parti joe make some money and soon joe take ratso on a ratso s dream spot florida the final five minut are heart break yet some of the greatest moment in the film from midnight cowboy we get a stark and sometim disturb urban view on life 
 
 
 
jon voight is brilliant in midnight cowboy but hoffman s perform though reminisc of his later turn in rainman is the kind of perform that keep me watch movi a a portray of a new york charact onli daniel day lewi portray of bill butcher in gang of new york come to mind a compar and day doesn t give his charact the emot depth that hoffman give ratso it s typic of hoffman s way of act that the actor we tend to identifi most with midnight cowboy is voight i think hoffman is one of the or best actor in the histori of film at play off the peopl around him in such a way that he rais their perform far abov their normal level voight s buck is so naiv that he would float out of the film altogeth except that ratso pull him down pull him down but also teach him a lot about how to surviv and more import how to live midnight cowboy is a movi about escap that turn into a movi about find yourself i think that a gritti a movi a it is it ha a veri beauti messag that no matter how much a loser you might be ratso clear defin loser if you can find a way to be true to yourself you are in posse of the secret of life and you might even be abl to share that insight with someon el i can t help but compar midnight cowboy to klute from a few year later which i think is more like a movi about find yourself that turn into a movi about escap 
 
 
 
i wa go through a list of oscar winner and wa surpris to see that this film beat butch cassidi and the sundanc kid for best pictur in after actual see it howev i m not surpris anymor it wa way ahead of it time in regard to it style cinematographi and use of flashback to help develop joe buck s charact the most amaz thing to me is the depth of joe buck s charact in such a short movi i think voight captur the naivet and the vicious when provok the two scene that realli caught me were after he get the blowjob in the theater and when the older man solicit him i think when he look in the mirror he s tri to see if it s realli him that ha done or is about to do someth terribl i think it wa a brilliant decis by hoffman to take this role otherwis he may have been typecast after the graduat anyway this consid an all time great for a reason

what make midnight cowboy into a success movi is the way in which joe buck becom bond to ratso rizzo through a seri of hardship that affect them both there realli aren t mani glimps of hope in this film for either charact but the hard realiti that beset them both give the film it own type of optim that these men can at least find human within each other this film featur jon voight s finest perform and probabl dustin hoffman s a well the rest of the cast is made up of unknown though it is round out by a fine seri of charact actor includ the cowpok on the bus at the start of the film also for those interest andi warhol s apprentic paul morrissey show up briefli dure the parti scene if you haven t seen this movi it is essenti check it out 
 
 
 
midnight cowboy made a big fuss when it wa releas in draw an x rate by today s standard it would be hard press to pull an r rate jon voight who ha been better is compet in his role a joe buck an out of town hick want to make it big with the ladi in new york citi he meet a seedi street hustler name ratso rizzo who tri to befriend buck for his own purpos the two eventu forg a bond that is both touch and pathet a ratso dustin hoffman simpli shine hoffman ha often been brilliant but never more so than in this portray he is so into charact that all el around him pale in comparison lose the academi award to john wayn is one of the most ridicul decis ever made by the academi of motion pictur art and scienc director schlessing ha a deft hand with his product but this film ha a grungi underbelli that leav a bad tast in the mouth of the viewer worth see for hoffman s perform alon

i sat down to watch midnight cowboy think it would be anoth overr s s movi some of my favorit film come from the s in the same vein a midnight cowboy taxi driver mean street panic in needl park etc but there are mani mani overr one a well that have gain strong reput amongst critic for be groundbreak unfortun a vast major of them don t hold up a well today i sort of feel this way about easi rider although it too is one of my favorit so i didn t expect much from midnight cowboy but got a lot back it s a touch stori well made and well told with some of the best perform of all time dustin hoffman a enrico ratso rizzo give one of his best it s a bit funni at time he sound like a cartoon charact when he speak mayb becaus of the lenni simpson connect but hoffman is entir convinc half of the film s budget went toward his paycheck a he wa just becom a major star in hollywood opposit him is the second bill jon voight a joe buck the cowboy who travel north to the big appl in the hope of becom a male prostitut soon his naiv way land him in troubl and he pair up with a crippl scam artist name ratso who offer to becom joe s manag for a certain percentag of profit the movi is quit long at two hour but never realli seem veri long some film can tend to drag especi some of the film that were made in the s becaus a it s been said in easi rider rage bull the director were the star of the movi in the s and occasion they got a bit too infatu with their materi go on too long examin charact scene etc that aren t import just about the onli scene i felt wa a bit too long and unnecessari wa the drug parti it make the film seem extrem outdat similar to the drug odyssey in easi rider and realli harm it flow becaus it s not need other than that midnight cowboy is an almost flawless motion pictur i wa pleasant surpris it doe have it flaw flashback are a bit tacki and never use a well a they could have been for instanc and some of the scene are a bit uneasi such a the gay movi theater sequenc but if you can handl it content midnight cowboy is a truli great motion pictur an uncompromis examin of life on the street in the late s earli s it s a depress movi yes and by today s standard might seem a bit outdat and heavi on the liber perspect of life is horribl etc but i still love it and particular the extrem touch end will stay with me for a long long time high recommend one of the best film of the s it wa technic releas in late but i d still categor it a a s film it also won the best pictur oscar be the first and onli x rate motion pictur to do so it wa later re rate r on appeal 
 
 
 
watch midnight cowboy is like take a masterclass in act direct cinematographi edit write i wa too young to watch it when it wa origin releas and onli saw it for the first time a coupl of year ago but it ha absolut stood the test of time and i have watch it sever time sinc everyth about this film is brilliant from the poignant perform from voight and hoffman even though i know this movi well i still find myself well up everi time voight flash one of his innoc pain look or hoffman cough in his sick and omin way to the stun cinematographi and superbl edit dream sequenc it s a shame that more of our contemporari filmmak aren t prepar to take a risk on make movi that are a visual and aural interest a this one midnight cowboy should be requir view at all film school 
 
 
 
in my opinion this is one of the greatest movi ever made in america and it deserv everi singl award it won and it s place on the afi top list though it s shame too low on the imdb top list at onli a of this write if you enjoy act of the highest calibr voight and hoffman are a superb match well drawn character and invent direct edit and cinematographi you ll love this just a much a i did schlesing paint a vivid alway credibl pictur of the late s new york citi scene and it s mani victim struggl to overcom person demon and surviv amidst the amor poverti and hopeless of nd street new york citi the filmmak techniqu employ here brilliant captur the feel of the underground new york film movement and of the citi and are noth le than dazzl i ve seen mani idea includ the rapid fire edit the handl of the voic over flashback the drug trip sequenc and the cartoonish face slip in dure a murder scene to convey angst and terror stolen by other filmmak the relationship between joe and ratso is handl in such a way a to be view a an unusu strong friendship or have it s homosexu underpin i think the director handl this in a subtl way not to cop out to the censorship of the time but rather to concentr his energi on the import of a strong human connect in life whether it be sexual or not midnight cowboy is a brave move film of magnitud influenc and import that ha lost absolut none of it s impact over the year so if you haven t seen it you re realli miss out on a true american classic i recommend this film to everyon score out of 
 
 
 
i typic don t like realiti show particular the one that are profit off of american idol s success but this one i can live with comedian from all around the world perform a brief routin for celebr talent scout and if they like them those guy will be sent to perform a routin for an actual audienc then ten or twelv comic are select to live in a hous togeth and do survivor style competit use comed tactic then one will be determin a last comic stand i do like stand up comedi so this is the one realiti show must keen to my interest there are usual some pretti funni comic select through it start the career of such talent a alonzo bodden ralphi may and josh blue my negat critic is the fact that there is the possibl that a lot of these comic were select for their contribut to realiti show drama at first they live togeth in a hous like big brother but now they ve done away with that thank god and there are a lot of comedian i felt were onli chosen not becaus they re funni but becaus of race ethnic attitud sex etc when other comic clear should ve beaten them out but overal it s a well made realiti show which are two term up until now i thought were an oxymoron 
 
 
 
horror is perhap one of two genr where logic doesn t alway win out over imagin we all know that killer like freddi jason michael and even leatherfac shouldn t be abl to sustain the amount of pain they do and still live to fight anoth day most of u don t believ that zombi realli rise from the dead to stalk peopl and eat their brain and let s hope that at least some peopl know that when you enter place like funhous and old mansion that unspeak crime are not go to be perpetr against them this is where imagin win out over fact horror and most film in general requir u to suspend our disbelief for a coupl of hour and just go with the flow this usual isn t a problem when i watch bounc ball be hurl down the stair at georg c scott or when i see an unseen forc stalk three amateur film maker in the wood near burketsvill but what i do have a problem digest without want to regurgit is when a film ha a killer like the one in this film to give away who the killer is would actual be a huge spoiler and it would take away all fun of watch it for yourself but just suffic to say that i actual enjoy this film right up to final scene when the killer is reveal there are too mani event in the film that transpir for it to make ani sen that the killer is who it is but the minut prior to this point is a well done suspens blood soak film direct with panach and skill by john hough if the film would have offer me a differ killer then i would actual be rave about it this may sound like a complet asinin reason to discredit the film but believ me anyon who ha seen the film is almost sure to agre with me john cassevet play dr sam cordel he and his daughter jenni play beauti by erin flanneri have just recent move to this small new england town cordel is a recent widow and it is unclear how his wife die we see sever flashback scene where a mysteri woman one can onli presum it is his wife is lay backsid on the ground dure a torrenti downpour her face is bloodi and her eye are close again i am not sure who this woman is and what relev she ha to the stori but she is there anyway cassevet it ha to be mention is strang to say the least cordel is a love father but his love for his daughter seem to be a littl more than just parent there are a few scene that hint of incestu possibl it never come to fruition but it just seem to be omnipot but somewher just beneath the proverbi rug thank the film never realli explor this element of the relationship but it doe make you a littl uneasi casevett seem like a cross between the porno actor john lesli and screen great jame caan he ha a decept smile and a viril command voic that make you sit up and take notic but he also look like he is about to disrob dure a busi luncheon in everi scene he just ha that slimi disingenu phlegmat uneasi way about him he never realli look like he can be trust in this film i guess that is a credit to the writer the director and to cassevet himself there wa alway someth that just bother me about his charact from the get go the stori begin on an excel note a two would be lover are swim in the local quarri there is a ricketi old chang shed near by and a we can see someth or someon is watch them when the young man briefli disappear to get someth from the truck the young woman wander into the shed just to play a prank onc she is there she is attack the young man dash to the shed to find her and he is impal with a board and nail hough shrewd set u up for the payoff pitch when the young man come in he look frantic scour the room and spot his would be lover bleed in the corner and then smacko the guy get it it is a veri ten moment and it start the film off on the correct note also introduc into the tangl wed of a stori is a young man name tim that seem to be have strang dream of a faceless woman that is bound in a tortur chamber surround by men with cloak cover their face tim seem to think that his dream have someth to do with the murder becaus everi time a murder take place he ha anoth dream toss in a quiet and turbid grandmoth a meretrici femal report and a strong yet venal local sheriff and you have all the ingredi necessari to creat the make of an imbroglio in the small town of galen throughout the film more peopl are massacr but most of the time the male are slaughter with extrem prejudic and the femal are rape this is my first feebl and care attempt to tell you that this is what left me unconvinc with the denouement it just didn t strike the right chord the incubus is a well done film it is ten tight and even most of the perform are veri well done i wa intrigu by the dream that tim wa have and i wa anxious to find out what signific they had to the stori and ultim to the murder but when you get through all that wa good in the film you are still left with that acerb tast in your mouth and bitter pill are alway more difficult to swallow than sweet one out of this could have been a nine too bad 
 
 
 
shock well made chiller is an undervalu tale of atroci murder and evil forc small town doctor tri to discov who or what is commit a seri of violent sexual murder incubus is a tight mysteri with some horrif murder sequenc that build to an off beat and eeri climat twist the murder scene are intens and gori so this isn t a film for the squeamish the direct of john hough along with a bizarr music score combin to creat a dark atmospher of dread that run through out the film it also carri a kind of gothic vibe a well nice film locat and some stylish camera work also highlight the cast isn t bad either the great john cassavet doe a solid perform a the new doctor in town also good are the perform of kerri kean a the local report helen hugh a the town historian and duncan mcintosh a a torment psychic teen all around incubus is a forgotten horror film that need to be re discov and re evalu out of

in brooklyn a centuri ago the rivalri between chuck connor and steve brodi and their compet volunt fire brigad lead to brodi s famous bet that he can jump off the brooklyn bridg this is a stori which will be familiar to a lot of peopl through a bug bunni spoof boweri bug from this general veri enjoy film would probabl be more wide avail if it were not for the notori and unsettl scene involv some chine tenement dweller a time capsul of antediluvian racial attitud give the film a great deal of histor interest in my view

a favourit of mine this movi tell of two feud new york charact steve brodi raft and chuck connor beeri who both strive to be the main guy in the boweri in the late nineteenth centuri brodi and connor were real peopl though this is a heavili fiction account of their antic base on a play brodi s legendari did he do it it s still a caus of argument jump from the brooklyn bridg for which he becam famous is shown here a happen around the same time a the spanish american war director walsh clear had a great affect for the period so beauti recreat here and it includ a wild rumbusti ragtim number from saloon singer trixi odbray a young pert kelton raft is at his slickest a brodi and beeri show again what a clever actor he wa a tough big heart and at time quit touch connor pretti fay wray is the love interest both the boy are pursu full of life and energi the boweri move at a fast pace unlik mani earli talki it is not an easi movi to find but is well worth look out for 
 
 
 
cull from the real life exploit of chuck connor and steve brodi in s new york the boweri is high energi and good natur but be warn casual racial epithet flow off the tongu of wallac beeri and littl jacki cooper the veri first shot might be startl this is true to the time it wa set and the time it wa made and it also speak to the diver of popul in that neck of the wood it certain add to the gritti flavor of the atmospher beeri a connor is the bluster thunder at the center of the action a loud mouth saloon keeper with his own fire brigad and he ha a soft spot for orneri orphan cooper raft a brodi is connor slicker better look rival in almost everi endeavor brodi could never turn down a dare and love attent lead up to a jump off the brooklyn bridg it is still debat whether he actual jump or use a dummi beeri is a bombast a ever with a put on irish american accent he is just the gruff sort of charact to draw child cat and ladi in distress this is possibl the most boister charact raft ever play and he even get to throw in a littl danc a well a a show of leg and again he mistak the lead ladi love fay wray for a prostitut cooper is a tough a either of them though he get a chanc to turn on the tear the highlight isn t the jump off the bridg but a no hold bar fistfight between connor and brodi that in closeup look like a real brawl between the princip it s sure someon bruis more than an ego 
 
 
 
when i saw the movi at first i thought that it wa bore becaus noth wa happen but when all the scari thing start to happen like when church die and is brought back to life and also gage and his mom die and there idiot dad ha to bring them back to life even though he now the warn and ignor jud this is not steven king best work i thought that his best work wa the shine i don t think that peopl who see this movi and comment on how aw it wa are wrong becaus all they think is that what were they think a if that person can do a better job in make a horror flick i mean make the gage evil and how he kill jud is genius make the most innoc most unsuspect charact into one of the killer is cool peopl who didn t like the movi are dumb becaus all it is a scari movi and noth all don t expect someth from a movi that it isn t it still in a general area wasn t that good i still recommend peopl to watch the movie

overal this movi wa excel for it time and will be interest for mani more generat to come although the plot is not accur to the book most everyth is correct the movi doe skip far ahead and doe miss some import part i found the book and readi and immedi wish that they had made a movi becaus i hadn t found out about the movi yet but later i found the movi in a bargain bin at wal mart and decid to buy it and see if it wa what i had expect overal i give this movi a out of for it good part relat accuraci and overal make sen and for it bad part larg time skip and small but notic inaccuraci

ah clich s clich s clich s they re a main part of a wide varieti of horror film this one ha a lot of them still it s stephen king one of the best master of horror this movi wa realli good just too predict and what horror movi doesn t have stupid peopl this one is overcrowd with retard victim just practic beg for their life to be taken pet semetari i found to be creepi a littl the way everyth is set up wa realli spooki but not terrifi for the most part the act wa somewhat believ the suspens wasn t that suspens but the entertain level is set at a major rank my eye were practic glu to the screen all stephen king fan must see this movi but a for anyon el expect an okay thriller 
 
 
 
so often with stephen king adapt you just get a collect of charact recit dialogu from the book this realli captur the heart of the book mayb becaus they don t use larg chunk of text straight from the book but it s a bit more of an improv of the event in the stori a big part of it success is miko hugh a babi gage dale midkiff and denis tasha yar crosbi realli act like his parent there s a scene where loui is cuddl gage and they are veri natur togeth fred gwynn is wonder he nail the main accent perfect without lap into parodi and is wise and warm just like jud should be out of 
 
 
 
 pet sematari succeed on two major situat first it s a scari horror movi those that just aren t produc in these day second it s an emot clever movi overal so if you are look for chill scare creepi and visual stun set great act dialong and gruesom effect this is the movi you are look for a classic now and truli a must see for ani horror fan probabl the best adapt to ani of king s novel the event feel a littl rush compar with the novel but that doesn t mean that this underr movi isn t a complet horror drama accomplish stephen king s novel is wide known for be veri emot and gruesom at the same time the movi captur the same feel main becaus there s a great charact develop and you can feel the love relationship between it s member then when everyth seem to be happi technic happi becaus the titl pet sematari doe not offer appi a tragic event chang the movi s atmospher now it turn veri dark the movi ha a sinist feel sinc the open credit but after gage is kill the movi becom sad gray creepi deal with the loss of a babi son is someth that can ruin a famili s entir life and pet sematari prove it dramat the legend behind the pet sematari is more than a myth that no one want to experi but sad and desper lead an emot destroy father to give it a shot sad enough the legend come true and babi gage return from the dead the previous encount with the pet sematari legend turn out to be a tragedi but this time it s someth much much wors what will happen with the live of our all american famili could pascow prevent this tragedi what is it with the surreal nightmar watch pet sematari to wit one of the most touch emot horror movi of recent time you won t regret the act is veri good although i didn t dig the actor who portray the father he didn t seem disturb enough when the situat ask for his desper but that s just my opinion denis crosbi truli deliv a great perform and work perfect a the nobl tender mother babi gage wa amaz even on his creepi part shiver overal this is a great classic of all time and a disturb movi that touch peopl s deepest fear the loss of someon you love the dead return to life and a feel of desper someth is for sure i don t wanna be buri in a pet sematari 
 
 
 
i am a fair big fan of most of the film that have been base on stephen king s book this one rate a one of the scariest and most memor i have just finish rewatch it for about the tenth time and i still find it heart wrench a well a scari the scene where gage is on a sure collis cours with the monster truck is one which stand out and the no fair utter by littl miko hugh near the end is a touch of brillianc 
 
 
 
pet semetari the creed famili have just move into the small town of ludlow the famili consist of a father loui a mother rachel a brother gage and a daughter ellen they are greet with kind by jud crandal jud is and could basic tell you about the entir histori of ludlow behind the creed s new hous there is a path lead to a pet cemeteri spell pet sematari when ellen want to go up to see it jud will take the famili on a trip that is the start of hell for the creed famili when rachel and the kid are gone ellen s cat church die jud feel that ellen isn t readi for the death of her cat so he suggest loui follow him further up the path past the pet cemeteri jud tell loui of this burial ground onc use by micmac indian loui buri church without jud s help a coupl of day later church return aliv but from hell this movi wa one of two horror movi that could actual scare me asid from the exorcist the greatest perform would ever be zelda rachel s sister with spinal mening or victor pascow a ghost who tri to help the creed from make the mistak of bring back thing from the dead the music in this movi play an extravag part it is at the same time sad and mysteri it goe along with the movi wonder 
 
 
 
i am a big fan of stephen king s work and this film ha made me an even greater fan of king pet sematari is about the creed famili they have just move into a new hous and they seem happi but there is a pet cemeteri behind their hous the creed s new neighbor jud play by fred gwyne explain the burial ground behind the pet cemeteri that burial ground is pure evil jud tell loui creed that when you buri a human be or ani kind of pet up in the burial ground they would come back to life the onli problem is that when they come back they are not the same person they re evil soon after jud explain everyth about the pet sematari everyth start to go to hell i wont explain anymor becaus i don t want to give away some of the main part in the film the act that pet sematari had wa pretti good but need a littl bit of work the stori wa one of the main part of this movi main becaus it wa so origin and grip this film featur lot of make up effect that make the movi way more eeri and frighten one of the most basic reason whi this movi sent chill up my back wa in fact the make up effect there is one charact in this film that is truli freaki that charact is zelda this particular charact pop up in the film about three time to be precis zelda is rachel creed s sister who pas away year befor but rachel is still haunt by her the first time zelda appear in the movi isn t general scari becaus she isn t talk or anyth but the second time is the worst and to be honest the second time scare the live out of me there is absolut noth wrong with this movi it is almost perfect pet sematari deliv great scare some pretti good act first rate plot and mesmer make up this is truli one of most favorit horror film of all time out of

hitchcock display his alreadi develop understand for visual in this earli silent film the plot of the film involv two boxer fight over a girl is straight forward drama without much to recommend it hitchcock s talent though is found in his stun use of imag near everi shot is fill with visual symbol especi memor is the jewelri that one boxer give the girl just befor she marri the other boxer he slide it up her arm in a clear sexual way and with one simpl movement hitch ha shown u all we need to know the box scene are handl well with some interest point of view shot that again prove how far ahead of his time hitchcock wa the film also give insight into his later treatment of woman the object of the boxer desir is driven by money and lust not reason or love the onli other woman in the film are either beauti parti girl who make open offer of sex or old crone who help to destroy happi relationship all in all the ring is a must for anyon interest in hitchcock s earli work and his develop a a visual storytel 
 
 
 
i sometim grow weari of read review of some of hitchcock s lesser known film becaus almost everi singl one start out with someon say this film is grossli overlook or this is a hidden hitchcock gem or a true hitchcock great or some other generic if onli peopl would watch this they would see that this is a great hitchcock film just a much a vertigo north by northwest psycho rear window etc so that be said i would just like to say that if onli peopl would watch this they would see that this is a great hitchcock film just a much a vertigo north by northwest psycho rear window etc now that may be overshoot a littl bit the ring is not by ani stretch of the imagin even in the same leagu a ani of those film mention twice abov but compar to the other film that hitchcock made in the late s and earli s i realli think that the ring is one of the best photograph and perform film of most all of them a an almost brand new director there are some astonish dream sequenc and brilliant segment of edit which show whi hitchcock wa generat so much attent earli in his career grant the film doe start with among other thing the high disturb spectacl of an idiot black circus perform and i use idiot in the definit manner the way stephen king so often doe have egg and fruit thrown at him by a crowd of not the classiest look white peopl i suppos this onli illustr how incred differ such circus and peopl were back then but i think it is one of the most off put sequenc in ani hitchcock film i ve seen the main attract at the circus is a fighter who claim to be abl to knock ani man down in one round but when he meet his match it is against a man that challeng his author not onli in the box ring but also in the ring around his wife s finger so begin an entertain if not veri ten challeng for the love of one woman who seem to sway from one man to the other effortless and thoughtless spoiler there is for exampl a scene where her husband watch her from abov a she is drop off at home late at night and just befor go into the build she is coax back to the car for a kiss this kiss is never explain and there is also the fact that even at the end when she prove faith to her husband or at least ultim choos him they look into each other s eye but do not actual kiss the film is certain beauti photograph even more so than sever film that hitch releas in subsequ year there is also a perform by gordon harker a one round jack s trainer who in his stone face expression remind me quit often of the brilliant buster keaton hitch leav it a bit ambigu but this is a great sampl of his earli work

it s been a long time sinc i saw this mini seri and i am happi to say it rememb merit have withstood the test of time most of the compon of a perfect spi the adapt of lecarr s finest novel in my opinion are top drawer outstand aspect of it are the music score and the master screenplay the latter written by arthur hopcraft who wa also i believ the screenwrit for tinker tailor soldier spi with alec guin a few year befor the actor are most veri good some superb like alan howard s jack brotherhood and ray mcanal s ricki pym peter egan is fascin to watch becaus his face chang with everi camera angl the passag of time and the effect upon the physic appear of the charact is veri believ done so much so that i wonder exact how old peter egan wa at the time of film the onli jolt come after the charact of magnus pym is transfer from the veri abl hand of a young actor name benedict taylor to those of a notic too old peter egan just fresh out of oxford but this is a minor and unimport seam in the whole egan ha troubl be convinc onli when the text becom melodramat and he need to be upset emot ie cri none of the actor have a veri easi time with these moment asid from the wonder franc tomelti who play peggi wentworth for all she s worth and steal the episod with ea jane booker is annoy a mari pym she ha part of the charact under her skin but often display an amateurish petul that diminish her a a tough cooki diplomat housewif which mari pym is r diger weigang is splendid a axel amus iron and brilliant i also enjoy sarah badel s camp turn a the baro the british view of american is vivid render in some dryli hilari scene when the yank have come abroad to confab with bo brammel head of mi the american conting are portray a empti head buffoon who appear to have memor a lot of long word out of the dictionari and spice them liber with american jargon and psycho babbl much to the bemus scorn of the english the humor and sad are subt blend lecarr ha a knack for mix dispar element in his stori and hopcraft ha brilliant captur the melancholi yet wist atmospher of the origin not a perfect product what is and yet the best of the lecarr adapt to reach film or televis to date high recommend to all spi thriller lover and especi lecarr fan dvd avail from acorn 
 
 
 
without doubt the best of the novel of john le carr exquisit transform into a classic film perform by peter egan magnus pym the perfect spi rudig weigang axel real name alexand hampel magnus czech intellig control ray mcanal magnus con man father and alan howard jack brotherhood magnus mentor believ and british control togeth with the rest of the charact are so perfect and natur the person respons for cast them should have been given an award even the small part such a major memburi are perform to perfect it say a lot for the power of the perform and the strength of the charact in the novel that despit the duplic of magnus one cannot help but feel closer to magnus and axel than to jack brotherhood and the slimi grant leder of u s intellig i have read the book at least a dozen time and watch the movi almost a mani time and continu to be mesmer by both if i had one book to take on a desert island a perfect spi would be the choic abov all other

 tarzan and his mate the second of mgm s tarzan pictur pick up a year after the event of tarzan the ape man tarzan and jane have been live happili in the jungl and harri holt one of the expedition in the first film return this time accompani by the le than honor martin arlington in quest of the ivori from the eleph graveyard natur a varieti of peril and excit adventur take place along the way the first film romantic everyth the jungl adventur romanc itself wild anim and even death the second film still ha a great deal of romantic and a lot of wonder action sequenc but a more serious tone under the action the charact dare to ask question like what if someth happen to tarzan what would jane do if she wa strand by herself in the middl of the jungl and she had to fend for herself while these are probabl the question real peopl would be ask in this situat it creat a certain amount of somber that isn t alway a much fun a the throw caution to the wind attitud of the origin one of the most enjoy aspect of this film is the growth we see in tarzan and jane s relationship tarzan still speak veri broken english but he ha clear learn a few new word from his mate addit their love for each other ha realli blossom and we feel like they realli have spent a year togeth in the jungl most peopl consid tarzan and his mate superior to the origin tarzan the ape man person i like the first film just a littl bit better the main reason is that the relationship between the harri holt martin arlington team isn t near a likabl a holt s relationship with jame parker jane s father from the origin the mr arlington charact could have work a a great movi villain but he play the hero for far too much of the movi the movi can never decid whether we should like him or hate him also i don t want to give anyth away but in one of the scene where we should clear hate him jane never find out about those event so the end isn t quit a satisfi a it could have been all of these detractor are relat minor howev and it s still a great movi like the first film tarzan and his mate ha amaz action scene wonder wildlif footag and one of the screen s all time greatest romanc if you like the first film in the seri this is definit a sequel to see 
 
 
 
when i wa a kid it wa lex barker s time a tarzan i often heard from older peopl that johnni weissmul wa tarzan and i wouldn t understand whi sinc i saw a coupl of weismul s last film in the charact and i thought he wa sort of out of shape it wasn t after mani year that i came across tarzan and his mate and then i understood weismul is in shape in this pictur and ha the presenc and rug look the charact demand not match yet by other tarzan such a barker gordon scott jock mahoney denni miller mile o keef and cristoph lambert a for this film i wa also surpris by the sensual presenc of beauti maureen o sullivan a strong self mind activ and no inhibit woman a jane way ahead of the time in which the film wa made tarzan push her into a pond nake a she is amus one of the explor kiss her by surpris and though she doesn t kiss him back she sort of let him do for a bit and make no big deal out of it such behavior were unthink with the jane to come such a brenda joyc vanessa brown virginia huston or dorothi hart all play sort of too perfect sweet vulner woman make it hard to believ they could surviv in a hostil place like the african jungl o sullivan charact s sparkl person steal the show out of tarzan himself except of cours when it come to action and weismul take the lead easili the combin is perfect anoth highlight in the movi is cheeta s secondari role and not a the main lead like in later tarzan pictur where she often save the day tarzan and his mate stand a a fine product in it genr tarzan film and perhap a the best though i have to admit that i also enjoy tarzan s greatest adventur made with a higher budget and a strong support cast and in spite of the just accept gordon scott in the lead role with his too perfect all gymnasium physic look that doesn t fit for a rustic ape man good for jane and her mate 
 
 
 
i recommend watch this film with your signific other if you re plan a romant even with him her the chemistri between johnni weissmul and maureen o sullivan a tarzan and jane is so steami it could fog up your screen after the origin film we begin to see how tarzan and jane have adapt to the jungl and to each other jane s skimpi jungl wear and tarzan s protest when jane cover up for their visitor illumin that they are not just romant but also quit sexual in love one s imagin can supplement the constant touch and love talk between tarzan jane to portray how much jane is actual teach tarzan about love emot romant and sexual and jane s student is not onli embrac but also thrive with his previous untap sexual the skin show in this film is off the chart in addit to jane s two piec sexi midriff leg and hip bare costum she also ha an underwat nude swim with tarzan although it is not o sullivan but olymp swimmer josephin mckim who doubl for her in this scene weissmul also reveal a tremend bodi and perfect pector in his bare there loincloth the ladi will delight when weissmul emerg from the water after his lengthi fight with the giant crocodil and sound his yell with his water soak loincloth practic fall off his hip it s a shame that the over protect censor tone down the adult natur of the tarzan film after this entri although the weissmul tarzan film would still prosper in the year to come they would rare approach the sex appeal of this movi 
 
 
 
a note by other review this is one of the best tarzan movi unlik other howev i like the begin of the film a it feel like a pretti accur depict of what a trade post must have been like plus the exposit is need so we know whi harri want to go back into the jungl in addit the begin of the film contain one of the most thrill and terrifi chase sequenc ever made this occur when harri s safari group ha to outrun a tribe of cannib the pre censorship product valu add a lot of realism genuin depict the terribl danger that await european go into the jungl the film also offer though perhap anteced an accur account of how horribl treat the nativ african were by their white employ in addit sexi jane thousand of eleph some great set and two cheta not to be miss an adventur classic

this movi ha alway been a favorit of mine sinc first see it a a year old kid in when it wa shown on a los angel televis station s late show the charact are veri engag from the start of the pictur and it is too bad that the movi ha never been releas for video tape nor is it ever shown on televis appar due to a prohibit by the estat of moss hart the playwright produc director who wrote the stori and first present it on the new york stage dure wwii the reason for deni it show is hard to fathom more than year after it wa made i did not see the movi again for over year when someon who had actual been a major cast member of the movi wa abl to get me a bootleg copi on vhs poor video qualiti but good audio my memori of it wa correct it wa still an engag and fascin movi to watch an amaz aspect of this film is just how mani of it star just start out in their career at the time went on to becam either major motion pictur star or at least well known and fulli employ actor e g judi holliday edmond o brien jeann crain barri nelson don taylor karl malden peter lind hay georg superman reev red button lee j cobb kevin mccarthi and gari merril the scene with the b liber are terrif especi the close up shot where the detail of the giant for those time engin bomber then manufactur now near extinct can be seen good insight into the differ level of train that a pilot cadet went through on his way to be assign to a bomber crew of cours veri gender bias a wa the trend of the day onli the men becam pilot the woman just support them in their role hard accept in today s world i hope someday it will be releas onto video for a new generat to enjoy

when peopl nowaday hear of a s drama they usual appear to creat a distanc of ironi claim that it s anoth tearjerk with great star in the lead of tragic melanchol role this opinion howev doe not resembl neorealist movi in particular this one direct by count luchino visconti ossession a his debut onc censor and onc cherish a near a realist masterpiec is still love by some peopl and strong critic by other the contradictori opinion about the film that have appear in these year seem to have been caus by the content of the movi itself except controversi for modern time a well a the past at the same time while be base on the novel by jame m cain the postman alway ring twice it is one of the most genuin screen adapt where director remain his own style view his own art i have seen the film twice and the second view led me to veri detail analysi part of which i d like to entail below first visconti s movi seem to touch all psycholog and action that peopl may do in life in particular those absorb by desir these peopl make such tragic decis in spite of terribl consequ they are bound to face gino massimo girotti a travel with bear like shoulder turn up at the crossroad of a motorway near ferrara and enter the tavern although mani peopl go there to have a meal gino occur to get someth more much more the indefatig desir of beauti giovanna clara calamai a woman alreadi marri to an elder man who run the bar mr giusepp bragana juan de landa her bodi and her song posse his mind total and from the moment of their first love the coupl plan to get rid of the old obstacl and build up a new life togeth howev are peopl bound to wrong deed in face of desir can one build love upon murder what is love and what is loyalti doe desir lead to a danger addict or even ob such question intens aris while watch the movi when to the core the viewer is suppli with an insight into charact we have to love each other affection answer giovanna seem give a cure to all cri conscienc but may desir love justifi and cure everyth isn t it what we both want say one of the coupl it occur that it s not therefor the content of the film appear to be veri danger if not analyz with intellect and heart yet it constant remain thought provok second ossession ha a veri strong point that talk to modern viewer brilliant moment and marvel cinematographi which go in pair with memor sequenc and visual power these make a modern viewer realiz that a film made almost year ago is absolut entertain to watch they rang from tast erot imag to pure technic shot who can possibl skip that moment in ferrara where gino meet a beauti girl a sort of ragazza perfetta perfect girl a dancer anita and buy her ice cream his desir show him total differ direct do viewer remain indiffer at gino giovanna s first meet the first focus of camera is on giovanna s leg seem repres carnal desir over love that gino experi a marvel of shot is gino and giovanna leav the investig room and the closeup of their shadow that direct our attent toward their suspici look third ossession can boast outstand perform both from the lead pair a well a the support cast massimo girotti onc said in an interview that work in this movi had been one of the most difficult job he had ever done yet consequ what come out is a flawless act he portray a bisexu man torn within desir who commit a crime but cannot stand ani of the object that remind him of his victim which repres conscienc his bisexu is indic through the charact of lo spagnolo elio marcuzzo whom he meet in veri surpris circumst in the train for ancona clara calamai who wa cast in the role after emin anna magnani had refus fit veri well to the role and we may claim that there is a true chemistri between the coupl they are both veri convinc besid i like juan de langa in the role of bragana he portray an old husband not affection to his wife and still crazi about high art in some of his most witti moment he ask his wife to wash his back or walk in the empti street sing his favorit opera song after sort of karaok perform in sum we a modern viewer who are capabl of critic view have to look at this film veri object it is art for sure thank to the aspect aforement it is a power stori a well thank to the controversi it carri yet is it educ visconti wa not fellini who said that he did not carri ani messag for human in such case his film would onli entertain which is of cours not entir fellini s style too visconti alway had someth to convey what did he want to say here is the film against bad marriag or is it against wrong action of peopl absorb by desir the final shock moment say for themselv though you don t have to agre with the vision ossession is realli a wonder realist film one of visconti s best 
 
 
 
to get in touch with the beauti of this film pay close attent to the sound track not onli the music but the way all sound help to weav the imageri how beauti the open scene lead to the expuls of gino establish the theme of moral ambigu note the way music introduc the charact a we are led insid giovanna s marriag don t expect to find much here of the polit life of itali in that s not what this is about on the other hand if you are suscept to the music of imag and sound you will be led into a word that reach beyond neo realism by the end of the film we there are moment antonioni like landscap that ha more to do with the inner life of the charact than with real place this is one of my favorit visconti film

this movi is great if you enjoy watch b class movi that is this is a classic colleg s slasher movi in which one song is play throughout the entir soundtrack a horribl film but worth rent to make fun of or just to watch old men pop out of closet with knive kinda funni if you ask me 
 
 
 
the combin of the superb black and white photographi and the eugen onegin with a twist plot made this a real knock out for me the atmospher creat by the most veri dark shot contrast with occasion veri bright overexpos white wa grip there wa a superb moment where where transpar appar convent holiday snap but where the face of the actor reveal charact and situat subt but instant were shown accompani by lenski s heart wrench aria from the tschaikowski opera eugen onegin for me the mark of a good film is that it should take advantag of the opportun present by that medium which mean that often the stori is le import than imageri and atmospher last year in marienbad is a good exampl of such a film krisana is in the same mould

i am normal not compel to write a review for a film but the onli commentari for this film thus far on is rather unfair so i feel it necessari to share my point of view krisana or a it wa titl at the theater i saw it fallen follow matiss a lone latvian archivist a he tri to learn about a woman whom he didn t tri to stop from jump off a bridg a well a her reason for do so that s the plot in a nutshel but this film is not concern with stori a much it is in depict the guilt of a man who fail to act a a detect who investig the incid tell him we usual don t bother to care about the anonym face we pas everi day until after they die comparison to michaelango antonioni and his blowup will most like abound in ani review you read about krisana the influenc of antonioni s philosoph and auster style and the stori of blowup are clear and in fact writer director fred kelemen make an obvious refer to that film in scene in which matiss attempt to come to know the woman who jump off the bridg or at least who he think did the onli other person to share his or her view on the film detract the colleg film class look and sound of the film he or she neglect to consid the budgetari constraint that an existentialist latvian film most like face but the atmospher black and white cinematographi and ambient sound succeed at an artist level to depict the solitud of matiss the background sound of wind and street nois lend an omin aura and remind one of a fellini film whether or not that wa kelemen s intent the filmmak undoubt had littl money but this constraint is use to the film s advantag krisana succeed a a charact studi with enough humor thrown in to keep it from be too self serious it could have easili fell into the trap of a mysteri stori but it avoid that and becom an intellig film about loneli and guilt if you are more concern with plot this film and it end may frustrat you otherwis take the time to be engag by it it is well worth seek out

i would say that this film give an insight to the trauma that a young mind can face when a famili is split by divorc or other disast i would high recommend this film especi to parent or individu plan to have a famili i found the charact to be appeal and high sympathet from a multitud of dimens the scari monster although probabl not scari to most adult ha a veri real hint of what the overact imagin of a child who is face unknown terror might creat i found the film to be delight 
 
 
 
jake s closet ha the emot power of kramer v kramer combin with the imagin of pan s labyrinth even the begin special effect seem to give a nod to pan s labyrinth but this is a stori that take place in modern time not in a war sixti year ago and in that way it ha even more reson today jake s closet is about a boy an onli child practic alon on summer vacat deal with his famili fall apart it s a horror movi like the other and the sixth sen a horror movi for the think person if you re look for a slasher movi this won t be your cup of tea but if you re look for a stori that is both touch and suspens with good act this is the movi for you at the screen i saw i swear there wa one moment where the entir audienc scream i high recommend catch this film

this is a fascin account of the hunt for the soviet union s first known serial killer i had tune in just expect a half decent tv movi but found myself drawn by the compel way the stori wa told a other have said there is much to admir here that is sad lack in mani big screen releas much of the credit must go to chris gerolmo whose intellig screenplay and direct draw the viewer in until it is imposs not to feel emot involv the act by the whole cast is also superb especi that of the two lead stephen rea and donald sutherland their convinc portray give their charact arc a great deal of credibl and the scene where they have their first committe meet after perestroika is genuin touch if you prefer your crime film with a bit more depth and a littl le sheen i strong recommend you look out for citizen x

i first saw this in the movi theater when it came out and the crowd wa realli into the movi which made the experi all the more fun this is a great cast of charact mani big name in it a few of which were not a recogn then a they are now i think it s a great idea if you follow ani of these actor or have love them in other movi to add it to your watch list some of the scene actual remind me of the type of well done comedi a in the birdcag or even the clue kind of odd spontan appear comedi with some realli profession deliveri from these belov actor the movi did a great job at give you some insight perhap even veri realist into the cultur of a daytim soap 
 
 
 
chris gerolmo took care not to simpli give u a `jack the stripper type of list of murder peopl he delv into the psycholog character with convinc result perhap most due to stephen rea s excel perform play off against donald sutherland with good empathi by both it wa the play of these two part abov all which made the film someth more than just a morbid account of the histori of the butcher of rostov support actor especi max von sydow carri out their part realli well good direct the photographi wa good too needle to say the fact that the film wa shot in hungari wa bound to produc a coupl of aberr but frank given the depth of the stori tell and interpret we can complet forget these littl trivialia for onc a made for tv film from hbo ha come up trump recommend especi if you like to analys characteriolog and forget some of the morbid scene which i hasten to add are never exagger 
 
 
 
though i saw this movi year ago it impact ha never left me stephen rea s depict of an invetig is deep and move his anguish at not be abl to stop the death is palpabl everyon in the cast is amaz from sutherland who tri to accommod him and provid way for the polic to coordin their effort to the troubl citizen x each day when we are bombard with stori of mass murder i think of this film and the exhaust work the peopl do who tri to find the killer 
 
 
 
imagin be so hamper by a bureaucraci that a one man spend year s of his life and ha a mental breakdown tri to solv a mass murder case virtual by himself the murder techniqu is clear but a govern unwil to admit the truth let s a monster destroy dozen of live when i think my job is stress i mere rememb the true stori behind this wonder flick the devot to duti of the main charact wa master portray by rea the comic and almost tragic at time relationship between rea and the sutherland charact made this one of my favorit movi of the last year the catch of one of the worst mass murder in histori had me on the edg of my seat while not near a well advertis and talk about a silenc of the lamb s the plot wa just a suspens rent or buy this movi today 
 
 
 
rea sutherland demunn and von sydow in a small role are all brilliant in their perform sutherland is particular adept at this sort of role where he must portray a charact whose moral is at first uncertain to the audienc a is so often the case with sutherland s charact we must ask is he a villian [in this case a minor one] or a hero this is a disturb stori intellig told about the incompet and fear bureaucraci in the old soviet union that imped the effort of extrem compet peopl a sutherland s charact wryli note the measur of a bureaucraci is it abil not to make special except the committe meet between rea and sutherland s charact after perestroika is enforc with it revel ha enorm emot impact you can feel the suffer of the dedic peopl who labor in that system the hand of dramat scene portray victim famili member add emot reson to the impact of the stori this is seldom a featur of a film with this sicken subject matter but effect remind u that the victim had live and were love this is a sad but veri import film which deserv it showcas on canada s histori televis

although the word megalmania is use a lot to describ gene kelli and sometim his danc is way too stiff you have to admit the guy know how to put on a show in american in pari he choreograph some outstand number some which stall the plot but are nonetheless amaz to look at check out gene kelli s get out of bed routin for starter gene kelli star a a gi who is base out of pari he stay there to paint soon he is a rich woman s gigolo but he realli love someon el hoari stori sure but the music number save the show here i realli love georg gu tari s voic work in this one his stairway to paradis and his duet with le gene on s wonder is s marvel oscar levant and lesli caron i can take or leav all in all a pretti good but not dynamit movi 
 
 
 
the best part of an american in pari is the lengthi ballet sequenc at the end where gene kelli and lesli caron are the live personif of sever major painter kelli ha earlier been establish a a pavement artist in pari so the sequenc is the logic end to a music burst with life and energi gershwin tune and cast member like georg guetari and oscar levant kelli wa at his best here it s a littl differ to singin in the rain and the effect of all the film a one top with the ballet give it a definit wow factor no wonder the sequenc end that s entertain after all other mgm music highlight had gone by 
 
 
 
what make for best pictur materi the oscar have come in for a lot of stick for reward overblown spectacl that have age poor and ignor the auteur who would be deifi in decad to come it wasn t becaus hollywood wa against art or creativ the academi award are the select made by the industri itself and that is whi at least in the classic era they tend to reward the greatest collabor the most sensat meet of creativ mind the arthur freed unit at mgm had been bound for oscar win glori for sever year by this point it wa onli a matter of time befor freed aid by his strongest director vincent minnelli and some the finest music star in the busi would land a best pictur freed had arguabl done more to rais the status of the music than anyon el craft pictur which wove stori and song togeth without lose the dynam spectacl of the s music the point about freed music is that the lyric of the song unlik those of hammerstein or lerner don t have to tell or even relat to the stori what s import is that the tone of the song and the way it is present fit into the structur of the film an american in pari wa the first of three freed music the other two be singin in the rain and the band wagon which took exist classic number out of their origin context and made them work in a complet unrel stori the word don t fit the plot but the routin fit the show so when gene kelli sing i got rhythm he hasn t even got a girl yet but the way it s done with the french kid join in is a great bit of characteris and the upbeat tune and danc give the movi the littl lift it need at this point an american in pari also use the rule break allow in the genr to add littl unconvent flight of fanci to tell the stori such a the seri of danc which accompani the descript of lesli caron s charact and what better director for this project than minnelli himself a painter and a pianist at this time there wasn t realli anyon who had a better feel for technicolor while some director would satur each scene in one colour or fill the screen with clash shade minnelli s colour scheme are tight control but never look forc in the open scene the tone are fair mute but not drab and in particular there is an absenc of red dure oscar levant and georg guetari s meet in the caf a few more vibrant shade are introduc then dure the first music number by strauss minnelli gradual bring in splash of red a tabl cloth a bunch of rose until it eventu domin a if the song ha awoken the pictur s colour scheme for most of the song the colour are choreograph a intric a the peopl howev in some number such a tra la la he keep the shade the same and instead open out the space a the song swell up and the charact becom more anim the achill heel of an american in pari is it stori i person find the romant angl particular unpalat play a it doe like a last hurrah for the misogynist love stori that reign suprem in the s the headstrong independ woman get reject while the meek delic girl is harass into love the hero even if you don t mind that it is difficult to connect emot with the stori becaus it is constant overshadow by the song and danc compar this to singin in the rain which doesn t realli have a mani great routin or memor set piec a an american in pari but it ha a win storylin singin in the rain wa overlook at the oscar yet it is regard a a classic of the genr today but i think peopl sometim forget that cinema is an all encompass form of visual entertain not just a mean of tell a stori an american in pari is not deep or engag or tear jerk but like a certain demill pictur that won the top award the follow year it certain is a great show 
 
 
 
this is a fine music with a timeless score by one of my favorit compos gershwin and a nice parisien atmospher which give the movi a lot of charm but in term of a stori well it s not realli there or at least not veri well work out the act is also not so smooth by caron but i like some of the dialogu i like the scene at the sein i like the charact play by levant the color and the danc of cours which is quit magnific a seem on the dot to me 
 
 
 
an american in pari is a wonder music about an american painter live in pari for inspir he meet a rich woman who admir his paint on the street and she believ she can get his work to be even more popular to the public e g in a museum golden globe nomin gene kelli a the artist jerri mulligan is just perfect at both sing and especi danc he also meet the main girl lise bouvier lesli caron who is engag to his best friend he can t help his feel for this girl even after he find out who she is engag to fill with nice romanc and wonder song and danc this is a veri good music film it may drag slight with his danc dream sequenc i e the american in pari ballet but there is a good happi end it won the oscar for best art direct set decor best cinematographi best costum design best music score of a music pictur best write stori and screenplay and best pictur and it wa nomin for best director for vincent minnelli and best film edit it wa nomin the bafta for best film from ani sourc and it won the golden globe for best motion pictur music comedi and it wa nomin for best director for vincent millenni liza s father gene kelli wa number on the movi star and he wa number on year star men i got rhythm wa number on year song the film wa number on year of music it wa number on year passion it wa number on year movi and it wa number on the greatest music veri good 
 
 
 
if i rememb ira gershwin the lyricist and brother of georg offer the gershwin catalog for this film and it wa snap up by the produc in mani respect it wa a typic s movi music by the freed unit at mgm and direct by vincent minelli with a lot of help from gene kelli the gershwin were of cours among the greatest of all broadway music team but in my opinion georg himself wa among the greatest of all american compos period gene kelli wa of cours one of the two greatest male dancer of the movi music one guess a to the other and i don t imagin his cast wa ever in doubt but i think the rest of the cast need some explan oscar levant wa a note person in his time and a an actual friend of georg gershwin he had to be in this film he wa a talent pianist and even a moder talent compos a well a a note neurot and hypochondriac and here a alway he play himself lesli caron wa an unknown at this time and she wa of the french gamin type a talent dancer she wa never a real beauti georg gu tari who play the part of mauric chavali oop i mean henri baurel wa greek and not french but he certain is more than ok a a french boulevardi even if a littl too young for the part gene s hoofer s voic is servic here but gu tari ha much the better vocal equip though gene wa better cast elsewher a obvious in singin in the rain where his charact is much more calcul even here he show himself to be someth of a heel at time he wa not for noth cast a the origin heel joey in pal joey the broadway music i wa not so enchant with his i got rhythm scene with the child which doe not appear a spontan a wa intend in my opinion i also found nina foch s charact milo to be rather irrit but the highlight of the film is obvious the lengthi ballet at the end of the film base on the titl music with set and costum in the style of the great french impressionist painter i found it difficult to believ gene and oscar a struggl artist and i don t think the music number are a well set up a they might be but on balanc the gershwin music is veri well serv in this film the dvd is well done with fine clear graphic when they are suppos to be and the mono sound is good but a trifl shallow 
 
 
 
 oxford mississippi at least okay the pari we get is pari culver citi apart from the establish librari footag of the real mccoy but it is pari in spirit than which noth nowher is better okay kelli is no astair but then who is and caron is no hepburn ditto but alan lerner is light year ahead of the vast overr comden and green who script kelli s other big s music singin in the rain a curious replic of lyricist write screenplay featur song by other lyricist and just to balanc thing the gershwin number are far superior to the arthur freed nacio herb brown number so alan lerner didn t have to feel too outclass the stori needn t detain u ani more than the anomali kelli hasn t got chang of a match and is a painter i e bohemian yet he is abl to scare up a perfect good suit at a few hour notic when foch invit him to dinner at her hotel in the well document love is here to stay sequenc the lover are strang unmolest by passer by other lover and the bridg in the background is total free of both pedestrian and vehicular traffic this is after all a feelgood music so it stand or fall by the score and in this case it stand four squar a feel good music go it s definit in the top

i felt it necessari to respond to the comment post on the front page of this film s page becaus some of it wa slight misinform origin i post quot from the origin poster but i wasn t sure if it wa proper given that this is the comment index and not a messag board though we use to use em that way back befor imdb ad the film messag board so i will edit this to make it unnecessari well first of all you may not be awar of this but gene kelli first becam famous for play pal joey on broadway in the origin product when vincent minnelli decid to make a gershwin panorama film he want kelli s charact to be more sophist than the goodi two shoe role he had been play in most his film with the except of for me and my gal alan jay lerner wa instruct to construct a new stori set in pari base on the stori of pal joey this gave kelli a chanc to play his famous role from broadway even though warner had outbid mgm for the right to pal joey in my opinion the wb film pal joey is a wreck though sinatra wa suitabl for the role but other problem sunk the film script chang and poor direct you complain that kelli s pictur are not well done even cite your art educ to prove the point but you miss the fact that kelli s bad art wa clear design to be bad and it is necessari for the stori charact the pictur are so bad the audienc know that kelli isn t readi for an exhibit even he know it though milo ha sort of sugar him up to the point where he almost believ her but it s import that the audienc not be sit there say but he s a great artist if he onli had the chanc you want the audienc to be fulli awar of his defici then you complain that he sabotag his interest in the show again you are not understand the structur of the stori he refus becaus he doesn t want to feel like a gigolo and becaus he know he s not realli readi for the exhibit his enthusiasm for the exhibit is certain not a great a joey s enthusiasm to start a nightclub but it serv the same function in the plot rememb it s essenti in pal joey the play that joey give up his nightclub after he realiz that he doesn t deserv it same with the art show if kelli s paint were actual good it would undermin this whole point then you complain that caron and kelli have no chemistri i guess it s in the eye of the behold i agre the chemistri between them is not a strong a it should be but for me it wa fine compar it to even wors forc romanc like the one between cari grant and sophia loren in the pride and the passion when you say that the big danc final ha noth to do with anyth el in this film it just show that you haven t dug beneath the surfac of the film into it symbol mani element in the danc sequenc relat to the stori and charact and through the danc the plot is resolv through imag and symbol it s about find love enjoy love then lose love he look around and his love is gone the movement of the symphoni are construct so that part of each danc scene mirror a separ phase of parisian art and also a separ phase of their relationship if you didn t see that it s not the movi s fault it s certain not a load of crap

gene kelli came up with some realli grand idea for music while with mgm here he s at the top of his creativ power work with the arthur freed music unit hard to believ when you watch an american in pari that the player never left the back lot at mgm the magic of an american in pari is due to the creativ edit under the direct of vincent minnelli and the set that mgm design blend with some background establish shot the idea of the film origin with kelli who want simpli to do a film with a lengthi ballet sequenc involv georg gershwin s tone poem an american in pari it sound good to arthur freed who approach ira gershwin who said fine with him a long a they use other gershwin materi gershwin got the kind of deal for gershwin music that irv berlin normal got not one note of non gershwin music is heard in an american in pari listen to some of the background music and you will hear thing like embrac you and but not for me which are not real music number anoth guy who wa a fair hand at write lyric alan jay lerner wrote the stori which admit is a thin one all about an ex gi play by gene kelli who after world war ii never left franc just settl into an apart on the left bank and proceed to becom a starv artist he live with eccentr compos oscar levant and doe that ever sound like a redund two woman are interest in him anoth expatri american play by nina foch who want to sponsor him a a painter if he ll reciproc in other matter but kelli fall for a shop girl play by lesli caron in her film debut caron also ha music comedi star georg guetari interest in here of cours the plot is just an excus to sing and danc to the music of georg gershwin an american in pari happen to be the first film i ever saw a an in flight movi on the first airplan trip i ever took i still rememb fli back from phoenix arizona to kennedi airport see gene kelli do i ve got rhythm my favorit number in the film howev is tra la la which kelli sing and danc all over the apart with oscar levant play the piano at one point kelli danc on top of the babi grand piano in a book about arthur freed i read a quot where he said in the american in pari ballet sequenc wa to be done with the background of the french impressionist which he felt the public would take to rather than a realist set on the street or back lot so it happen that way kelli had done lengthi ballet sequenc in word and music the pirat and on the town but this one top them all still doe in my opinion and that includ some of gene kelli s later film in a surpris upset at the oscar an american in pari wa chosen best pictur for beat out the heavili favor a streetcar name desir i guess fantasi trump realism that year big budget also have an upper hand in these thing a well still an american in pari is one of the best movi music ever done and sinc the studio no longer have all that creativ talent under one roof someth le like to be repeat

this ha by far been one of the most beauti portrait of a person that i ve ever seen on screen andi goldsworthi is a kind of man that is upon extinct he view the earth and natur with such admir and respect that it s primit in a good sen his puriti honesti and kind breath clear a you watch him work in such simplist yet full of life momentari piec of art i wa amaz how patient he creat his piec and how patient he accept their end sometim prematur but his scottish sen of humor cover his disappoint brilliant the film is shoot eleg and contain the same flow that goldsworthi s art ha it combin natur and art in a minim way a it is in itself fred frith s score is organ enough that it blend everyth togeth without interf with it naturalist sound this is overal a great piec of work in everi aspect it ha no boundari a far a age goe 
 
 
 
the scottish artist andi goldsworthi fashion natur materi into ephemer artwork assembl rock into egg shape cairn fill riversid rock pool with fieri flower and stitch thorn and twig into intric web pattern an origin work and a few photograph of his other creation are tuck away in a corner of southampton art galleri near where i live but although i found these piec intrigu i onli realis the wonder of goldsworthi s work when i wa lucki enough to catch a re screen of river and tide thoma reidelsheim s film accompani by a beauti instrument soundtrack by fred frith bring goldsworthi and his art to life by show the artist at work the open scene captur him fuse icicl fragment into a snake like thread set atop a tree stump work with his teeth and bare hand goldsworthi craft a beauti ephemer work befor long this delic sculptur melt away to noth in the brilliant nova scotian sunlight this scene is among the most beauti in the film but the breadth and invent of goldsworthi s work is remark reidelsheim show both the success and the failur captur the frustrat of piec that collaps befor they are complet a well a the glori of those that shine even if for just a few hour minut or second goldsworthi himself provid the narrat speak slowli but thought about the theme in his work he make plain his need to work with natur to be alon in it and to further his understand of it through tri to work with natur materi even when they seem to be work against him at time he is down to earth and humor at other time he struggl for the word to express his purpos someth which is quit understand when wit his astonish work first hand the river and tide of the titl becom increas pertin a we see the natur materi pas through the artist s hand flow from one form to the next the captur of the creation and dissolut of goldworthi s work is in itself a strike piec of art although goldsworthi work with wide vari materi and cover territori across north america and europ the present of artwork one after the other in this film is exhaust it gave me the same feel of fatigu that i get when i spend too long in an art galleri and struggl to take in anyth new a brief interv in which we are introduc to andi s famili and hometown is all that break the long success of his artwork nevertheless reidelsheim doe a superb job in photograph goldsworthi and his creation locat them in their wider environ from meander canadian river to raini scottish hillsid fit the film end with goldsworthi cast hand of earth and snow into the sky fleet pattern emerg from the dust particl even a they dissip into the air this is the purest express of the beauti to be found in the work of this remark artist 
 
 
 
andi goldsworthi is a taoist master of the first order express the way through his sublim ephemer art inde time and chang is what his work is fundament about i bought his first book sever year ago and my famili ha marvel at it mani time so it wa a treat to get to know the artist person through this film he is just a patient and gentl a you would expect and ha some wonder thing to say about the natur world the deepest of which are express in his occasion inabl to say it in word at all he is like most child who play in the great outdoor alon if they do anymor creat thing from stick and sand and mud and snow befor they outgrow it mr goldsworthi wa given the gift and the mission to extend that sort of play to creat profound vision of natur and to open our often weari eye to it in brilliant new way and alway with the utmost respect gratitud and humor of a wander and wonder monk 
 
 
 
greet again from the dark insight into the mind and motiv of a wonder artist how strang for most of u to see someon who must work no matter the condit el his reason for live ceas to see goldsworthi s sculptur come aliv and to see his reaction to each is extrem voyeurist this artist creat becaus he must not for money or fame it is his lifeforc when you see his failur energi seem to expel from his bodi like a burst hot air balloon it is not the dread of begin again it is that he take his energi from his work watch him creat just to have natur takeov and recal his work is somewhat pain but nonetheless breathtak he discus flow and time in the minim dialog and there appear to be littl doubt that the artist and the earth are one in the same when he say he need the earth but it doe not need him i beg to differ onli complaint is the music score seem to slow down further a pace that is relax at best 
 
 
 
i saw this film at the rhode island intern film festiv and wa complet blown away the structur and execut of the film wa fantast i know it won t but it realli deserv an oscar nod cal and andr were phenomen a the two disturb classmat yes the film is veri controversi and i can see a lot of peopl have a lot of problem with it a it deal with school shoot and especi make you identifi with the killer howev despit it harsh and blunt subject matter zero day is so worth watch i m look forward to it come out on video so i can buy it it s veri veri good veri power and intens the end shoot sequenc leav you speechless becaus it s almost too realist their uncertainti the record the footag and panic of the student total indescrib i realli hope it get the attent it deserv it s done in the same format a the blair witch project handheld camera made to appear a a true home video documentari kind of film but god is it infinit better veri impress hat off to everyon involv if you ve got the chanc you realli should see it 
 
 
 
what is most disturb about this film is not that school kill spree like the one depict actual happen but that the truth is they are carri out by teenag like cal and andr normal kid with normal famili by use a hand held camera techniqu a la blair witch ben coccio succeed in bring u into the live of two friend who have some issu with high school although we aren t ever told exact what is behind those issu they seem to be typic a lot of peopl hate high school so what a part of you just doesn t believ they will ever carri out the veri well thought out massacr on zero day the surveil camera scene in the school dure the shoot are made all the more power for that reason you can t believ it s realli happen and that it s realli happen the hand held camera techniqu also creat the illus that this is not a script movi a brilliant idea given the subject matter 
 
 
 
this is the best movi i ve come across in a long while not onli is this the best movi of it kind school shoot the way ben coccio the director decid to film it wa magnific he film it use teenag actor who were still attend high school he film it in the actor own room and use the actor real parent a their parent in the film also the actor were film too use camcord make it seem much more like a video diari it is almost art if that is inde a word there are a few slip up howev for exampl when cal call brad land rover a rang rover or vice versa it s been awhil sinc i ve seen it 
 
 
 
this movi is about a fiction soap opera it is veri fast and funni to say anyth el would ruin the movi there are sever plot and sub plot in the movi this movi ha ensembl cast with today s hottest star they all give over the top perform this movi is favorit of mine from the year soapdish is perfect for fan of either daytim soap opera or prime time soap opera if you watch soap go check this movi it s hilari 
 
 
 
everyon know about this zero day event what i think this movi did that eleph did not is that they made u see how these guy were they show their life for about a year throughout the movi we get to like them to laugh with them even though we total know what they re gonna do and that give me the chill caus i felt guilti to be cheer by their comment and i just thought cal wa a sweet guy even though i knew what wa gonna happen you know even at the end of the movi when they were about to commit suicid and just decid if they did it on the count of or i thought this wa funni but still i wa horrifi to see their head blown off of cours i wa i got to like them they were wick mayb but i felt like they were realli normal guy that they didn t realli realiz it but i knew they were that s imo the main forc of this movi it make u realiz that our friend or relat or anyon can be plan someth crazi and that we won t even notic it this movi a good a it wa made me feel bad and that s whi i can t go to sleep right now there s still this littl feel in my stomach butterfli 
 
 
 
a a fan of look further into the phenomenon that is school shoot this film took an interest and differ approach to the idea present a a seri of video record made by the two troubl men i cannot refer to person who kill a boy or teen the month of prepar lead to zero day the codenam for the day on which they will attack the film tri to present the situat from the opposit end of the gun it seem intent on portray the pain they suffer yet focus on the liter prepar the problem is that littl in term of emot is direct deliv the onli point at which emot becam overwhelm wa the end a expect but lead up to this point it s never realli clear a to whi they are plan this out we are told the obligatori stori that they were mock but the film also seem to contradict this without ruin the film it s easi to say it wa a great attempt and had equal great intent but fall short becaus of sloppi film make all direct is amateur to further the homemad video concept but the stori and continu is weak the film seem to want the audienc to decid a lot but also fail to provid the inform for such an event the end is abrupt and doesn t feel like it finish everyth that the film began 
 
 
 
in my honest opinion everyon should see this movi at least onc it realli put thing in perspect a i watch it though it wa fiction this movi is about someth that could happen to your child it show how easili two kid can hide both their hatr for their school and their plan to murder innoc student this film would not have work in ani other format they pull off the hand held camera perfect it remind u of april th when eric harri and dylan klebold murder student and then themselv it also remind u of the medium storm that follow after everyon want to see the rampart video and everyon want to see the basement tape this movi is a fiction version of our dream come true we get to see the kid behind the monster the onli bad thing about this movi is that it did not do well on the market and few peopl even know it exist if it would have had a singl preview on a singl blockbust movi everyon would have gone to see what the big deal wa about zero day i believ this is the best film adapt of a school shoot of the few that have truli attempt it the shoot itself onli take up about ten minut of the hour and a half long film becaus it most focus on cal and andr and what they did up to that point if you have not yet seen this movi go rent it and watch it i guarante that when it is finish you will be speechless 
 
 
 
i just came back from the montreal premier of zero day and i m surpris a hell to find a negat comment on the movi basic the blame is about coccio do an easi and overplay social messag well mr i m a review it s an easi and overplay critic of movi with a social charg not that i want to expo my life here but i come from a small town with a similar school than these guy go reject ignor on the menu thing is i understand how can young kid can be driven to do such horror high school have becam battl field of conform it s a real ugli sight you need to fight your way into be like the other it s hard to explain bit a lot of peopl dosen t realiz that high school are becom cemeteri of human intellig meanwhil parent are close their eye and smile about how their life in their comfort suburb is perfect the real motiv of the movi isn t about what is drive them it s about this death like calm suburb and everybodi close their eye and tri to creat this atmospher of a perfect town cal express it well it s a wake up call drama is everywher and it can take everi shape in that case littl drama like andr be call a faggot for wear a j c penni shirt are shape into be the wors nightmar of a whole town andr cal took the most extrem way to express their pain the malais of unconform in an era where you need more than ever to be like the other to be accept i like particular the last scene where some guy are burn the cross of andr cal like if with the pain they communic cal andr have communic their blind rage to their communiti their refus to think about the caus of some act it might seem aggress a a movi but coccio is medit more than whine or enunci what andr cal are live is a realiti and a scari one that might get to other kid disturb movi home make and strong feel made ben coccio do a veri veri disturb movi

love this film also saw it when it wa first shown i n germani in a small independ cinema in frankfurt it wa realli crowd and it wa a veri ambiti atmospher to the erot of the movi hit the spectat and the discus with moritz boerner the produc and director wa alway underlin by that in his genr it wa a veri ambiti movi even especi when you think that it wa an independ movi it doesn t exist much copi of that film mortitz boerner came from the theatr and made two or three short movi more work for tv a well befor he becam a sort of therapist for the peopl who wish to see that movi again you could find it on his homepag which isn t that easi to search for but it possibl 
 
 
 
this is one of the veri few movi out there which are veri erot without be pornograph despit there be onli a veri rudimentari plot there s not much live sound or dialogu instead the actor do voic over describ their experi whi they particip etc it s a document it s mind blow i can total understand whi nobodi el ever tri to do someth like this there alreadi is someth like this this nb the produc doesn t have the right to distribut a dvd version i ve also never seen it be sold anywher one may email mr boerner and order a copi on vhs 
 
 
 
sinc wa onli a toddler when this show origin air i just recent pick up the dvd set and am wish there were more episod film this show wa a s version of the poplular s tv seri x file but with a bit more of a comed light heart approach but don t get me wrong some of these episod have full on horror theme mani in which have some pretti greuesom plot left to the imagin of cours this wa the earli s televis some of the plot where a bit silli a well a the act but that is the charm and attract to this seri whether you like mysteri crime drama comedi or sci fi horror theme this seri brought all that togeth each episod clock in at around minut or so hour with commerci and that minut goe by quick alway leav me want more a great classic show that is underr in my book 
 
 
 
kolchak is sheer entertain great stori and a great cast and noth el to weigh it down darren mcgavin give an energet perform that pull the audienc along with him simon oakland jack grinnag and ruth mcdevitt give mcgavin the kind of solid support that most lead actor can onli dream of have some excel guest star add colour and verv to individu episod erik estrada in legaci of terror phil silver in horror in the height antonio farga in the zombi it s easi to see how a boyhood spent watch kolchak drove chris carter to creat the x file darren rip simon rip ruth rip

 kolchak wa a tv seri that realli didn t fit into ani categori part horror part comedi some social awar thrown in and what we have is someth that i think peopl weren t readi for it s a shame realli a i ve start to watch these show on the chiller network i never saw the origin i realiz how differ and interest it realli wa star darren mcgavin a kolchak a report for the intern news servic and simon oakland a his alway angri bos toni vincenzo the show follow the exploit of a chicago news report who more often than not becam a part of the stori himself a he search the windi citi for modern day creepi that go bump in the night the under charm of macgavin realli set the show apart a somewhat goofi guy who alway wear the same suit you cannot help but love him his joke are great and the back and forth between him and the skeptic editor oakland are downright hilari the stori are for the most part pretti good and the act is veri good the s were not a great period for special effect and the show suffer for it but if you suspend disbelief what you have is a fun seri that wa ahead of it s time 
 
 
 
i love kolchak the night stalker sinc i saw it on the night it premier on septemb i love the monster which seem scari at the time and the cool music by gil mell hey where s the soundtrack guy and have often thought about what make this show work for me so complet and have final conclud that the reason it endur when mani other do not is one simpl import element it ha that almost no other scari show seem to have and that is a main charact that most peopl can relat to on an everyday level when darren mcgavin s carl kolchak start to discov odd situat he react like most peopl would he find them odd and a he get closer to danger he is frighten even if he know he must move forward to tri to defeat whichev menac is be showcas in that episod it s rare that he is brave enough to stand up against some superior supernatur forc he s usual set a trap and is hide or wait in the wing to see if it work sometim he seem a surpris that he manag to defeat a foe a we are in one episod he goe to find a monster in a sewer but when he first see it he run to get out of there but is trap so reluct he must go back and defend himself he s heroic becaus he is will to do thing most of u probabl wouldn t do but that doesn t mean he probabl wouldn t much rather someon el did it instead of him he s a regular guy do a job tri to make a buck not a monster hunter he just get wrap up in thing involv the supernatur which he ha an interest in but he doesn t want to be hurt or kill anymor than ani of the rest of u do if his plan to defeat the creatur didn t work you will often see him run for his life to get away from it which is of cours what i would do in the situat that s whi i wa often watch the climax of the show through my finger a a kid kolchak wa likabl and you care if someth bad happen to him you were scare for him and for the other charact too the produc and writer obvious knew that anyon can creat a monster suit scari music and direct a suspens scene but it s all for naught if you don t care about the charact darren mcgavin said that the reason whi the show onli last on season wa becaus he got tire of do a monster of the week show and he decid not to continu i can tell you i mourn when this show wa cancel when i wa a kid but a an adult i can see whi it couldn t go on in that formula for veri long i still love the episod and two movi that star mcgavin a the bumbl determin and brusk but good heart report for the in known a carl kolchak i serious doubt anyon who make show or movi will ever realli understand whi i love the show it s not the monster dark lit set creepi music or goofi guest star although they are all vital ingredi the secret to it s success is right there in the titl kolchak the night stalker without mcgavin s lovabl bumbl carl kolchak to root for and to care for then it just ain t a night stalker

this is the neil simon piec of work that got a lot of prais the odd coupl is a one of a kind gem that linger within you got felix ungar jack lemmon a hypochondriac fussi neat freak and a big thorn in the side of his roommat oscar madison walter matthau a total slob these men have great job though felix is a news writer and oscar is a sport writer both of these men are divorc felix s wife is nearbi while oscar s is on the other side of the u s the west coast well what can you say two men live in one roof togeth without drive each other crazi is imposs a well a improb it s a whole lot of laugh and a whole lot of fun i like the part where when those two british neighbor that speak to both gentleman and after oscar kick out felix he get lucki and live with them when he refus to have dinner with them the night earlier it s about time that felix need to lighten up i guess all neat freak neat to lighten up they can be fussi yet they should be patient a well a veri fun movi and a nuevo classic neil simon s the odd coupl is a must see classic movi star 
 
 
 
matthau and lemmon are at their veri best in this one everyon el in the movi are also great the dialogu is excel and veri veri witti and the scene where lemmon s charact attempt to clear out his sinus in a restaur have me roll on the floor with laughter everi time i see it anyon who happen to see the not so great sequel should not be turn away from the origin i recommend this wonder movi to everyon i just love it and the fact the jack lemmon play his charact so straight forward with tragic overton onli add to the hilari in my opinion these two great guy made a string of movi togeth but this one is the best no doubt 
 
 
 
the first time i saw this i didn t laugh too much at the time i wa onli about fifteen year old and thought that mayb some of the deeper humor wa too matur for me to understand at the time i had the same reaction when i view it a second time a few month ago and this time it wa becaus felix s abort suicid attempt at the begin of the movi kind of darken the movi a bit this scene made some of the thing oscar said and did to felix later in the movi seem needle cruel and their person clash weren t a amus a they could have been had i not alreadi known the stori i would have been worri that some of oscar s antic to felix might push him over the edg a it wa it didn t make me laugh or smile like the televis show with jack klugman and toni randal did still all in all a pretti good movi and it spawn one of the greatest sitcom on televis out of 
 
 
 
neil simon ha quit a bodi of work but it is the odd coupl that carri him to fame this film realli work jack lemmon walter matthaw have a great chemistri the support cast for this film is stellar a well it is about men live togeth who are from opposit planet the script bristl with humor from this situat this had been done in some form previous this is the one that bring it all togeth in a veri good packag simon ha done some other decent work but this one is realli his best work which made the rest of his work possibl it is hard to imagin simon ever top this 
 
 
 
the origin movi the odd coupl ha some wonder comic one liner the entir world it seem know the stori of neurot neat freak felix ungar and funni obnoxi slob oscar madison this pare of mismatch roommat creat one of the most success tv seri of all time a well a countless not anywher near a good imit the odd coupl movi ha some wonder joke about oscar s apart and his sloppi habit he say who want food one of his poker player buddi ask what do ya got oscar say i got brown sandwich and green sandwich what s the brown it s either veri new chees or veri old meat i also love the line about oscar s refriger it s been out of order for two week i saw milk stand in there that wasn t even in a bottl there is no question that walter matthau s oscar madison is a joy to watch on screen he s almost a good a jack klugman s version in the tv seri the problem with the movi is jack lemmon s felix ungar jack make a veri veri honest effort at the role the problem is that he make felix so depress and down trodden that he becom more annoy than comic toni randal s perform in the seri brought the kind of humor warmth and sensit to felix s charact which lemmon s portray lack toni s felix unger obvious could be annoy some of the time howev in the tv seri it relat to specif situat where the annoy wa need in the storylin jack s felix ungar note the differ spell in the movi seem to never be happi fun or interest the movi felix ungar is a roommat that drive you up the wall all the time the movi still ha great moment that withstand the test of time the famous meatloaf fight is one of the greatest scene ever one of the other great exampl of felix s littl note on oscar s pillow will be rememb forev howev there are some darker side where oscar goe over the top his cri near the end after bawl out felix and a scene involv felix s linguin dinner although lighten by a funni line seem more depress than comic perhap there wasn t enough time to see the lighter side of these charact that made the seri so memor in the movi the begin minut are veri bore the same issu occur with felix s convers with the pidgeon sister the movi s end is predict and too pat there s veri littl care or compass for each of them by the other the result is that the darker side of the film lead to a lot of depress and anger rather than comedi unless you are watch the great scene describ abov it appear that jack lemmon s monoton persona of felix bring the film down rather than enhanc or embrac the comedi between the charact it realli took the s tv seri to make the odd coupl the best that it could be the origin film is still veri good howev the tv seri is much better 
 
 
 
i think that this is possibl the funniest movi i have ever seen robert harl s script is near perfect just check out the quot section on second thought just rent the dvd sinc it s the deliveri that realli make the line sing salli field give a comic over the top perform like you ve never seen from her anywher el and kevin kline is effortless hilari robert downey jr is typic brilliant and in a veri small role kathi najimi is a riot a the beleagu costum i wa never much of a fan of elisabeth shue but she s great here a the one real person surround by a bevi of cartoon charact on the set of the sun also set that rumbl you feel beneath you is hemingway roll over in his grave either that or he s laugh realli hard five star funni funni funni 
 
 
 
the odd coupl outta star like most peopl i will alway feel that jack klugman and toni randal are the definit odd coupl their incred work on the tv seri from the earli to mid s wa a highwat mark for televis at the time easili surpass the stage and screen version of the tale nonetheless how can you go wrong with a jack lemmon walter matthau pair matthau is in especi good form a oscar the slob lemmon take a bit of get use to a felix particular if you have previous seen toni randal s outstand perform the script is good definit neil simon s best i will go on record here a state that neil simon is probabl one of the worst most over rate playwright of american theatr the storylin is simpl felix a neat freak and newli separ from his wife move in with oscar the slob who need some help save money for alimoni payment their live arrang becom much like a marriag a well culmin in some amus tiff and spat lot of fun and some great one liner 
 
 
 
i don t think i ve realli ever given walter matthau his due a a comed perform he s certain been wonder in plenti of lightheart role but i guess i alway put his success down to his charact grumpi and ruthless a gruff contrast to the flamboy person of his frequent co star jack lemmon and i suppos a natur extens of his earlier work in dramat pictur watch gene sak the odd coupl adapt from a popular neil simon play the realis sudden click matthau is in his own right absolut hilari initi strike the audienc a filthi crude and general unapp his oscar madison eventu manag to worm his way into our heart culmin in a hilari overplay confess of emot that matthau rasp out in a voic not entir his own at the same time while hold his own a a comedian his interplay with lemmon is of cours pitch perfect inde the film right belong to both actor who have never fail to light up the cinema screen by themselv let alon togeth call to mind billi wilder s screenplay for the apart this neil simon comedi build itself around around a rather morbid premis compuls hous cleaner felix unger lemmon have just been evict by his wife of twelv year attempt to commit suicid but fruitless abandon the idea after he wreck his back tri to open the hotel window deject he arriv at the hous of good friend oscar matthau a divorc slob who live alon on a diet of potato crisp and green sandwich that might contain either veri new chees or veri old meat oscar kind offer felix a place to stay but is soon overwhelm by his friend s finicki person and constant insist on absolut cleanli the pair form an unusu sort of marit arrang with felix assum the role of the effemin and constant nag wife and oscar a the sloppi unappreci husband who alway come home later than he s suppos to this is a marriag that bare last three week and by the end of it we can complet sympathis with felix s ex wife who remain unseen the odd coupl is a terrif comedi most of all becaus it ha a lot of heart for all their argu it s obvious that the two roommat have plenti of affect for each other most move seen when felix tri to launch into a furious tirad instead perhap inadvert end up inform oscar how top he his the pair s four poker buddi john fiedler herb edelman david sheiner and larri hain are also constant badger each other about some obscur annoy but you can t deni that they ve got the best of intent their decis to treat felix a though noth ha happen to him may have sound fine in theori but mayb be ignor wasn t quit the correct solut to felix s gloomi feel of inadequaci and inconsequenti unlik some comedi base on popular stage play i wa recent disappoint by wilder s the seven year itch this film doesn t simpli strike at the same chord throughout and the relationship between the two lead is progress develop through tear laughter and much disagr 
 
 
 
jack lemmon and walter matthau began and end their career togeth rememb best a the grumpiest of old men a well a the oddest coupl to have ever made u laugh lemmon and matthau were one of hollywood s best love comedi team of the last year not a raunchi a pryor and wilder instead they were the classic comedi team that reflect a more modern marx brother routin such a the physic comedi a well a the mix blend of chao that marx chaplin and keaton were so famous for in the odd coupl lemmon and matthau play complet opposit that creat the chao the physic comedi is a uniqu a chaplin the joke is usual on themselv a oppos to pas the joke onto anoth not your typic guy film it is in a way a come of age comedi with two old men a oppos to two young teenag in their prime the chemistri between lemmon and matthau is entertain enough although this movi isn t for everyon this is a great comedi 
 
 
 
 the odd coupl is one of those movi that far surpass it reput peopl all know it they hum the theme song they complain of live with a sloppi oscar or a fastidi felix but they re under sell the film without know it this isn t just about a neat guy live with a sloppi guy it s a portrait of two friend help each other through the agoni of divorc it s also damn funni from start to finish but it s the kind of comedi that aris from realist stress and just plain aw situat so some viewer have actual found the film to be a bit uncomfort but i think it verisimilitud is it strength besid matthau s bulldog face just crack me up my favorit comedi by a countri mile 
 
 
 
it s veri funni it ha a great cast who each give great perform especi salli field and kevin kline it s a well written screenplay by andrew bergman honeymoon in vega i don t like soap opera even though i never watch them but i do love this film becaus it s so crazi and off the wall that it beat the hell out of ani stupid soap that they have on daytim televis in my opinion it s the best film of

in the s studio would use short film like this one sort of a test ground for new actor given their relat ea of product in comparison with full length featur film so it s interest that this one should star shirley templ who had long sinc establish herself a the most famous child star of all time then again she probabl wasn t the one be test i would imagin that would have been frank coghlan jr who play shirley s brother sonni in the movi and deliv a compar le impress perform then again a year old shirley templ wa probabl not an easi act to accompani the film open with an unimpress sight gag involv a leaki ceil which i suppos wa design to have shirley templ give a scorn look at the ceil illustr the work class status of the famili in the movi and provid a clean transit into the next scene which featur shirley gleefulli stomp in the rain it s sonni y birthday and his father make occasion and horrend botch effort to hide the fact that he want to give sonni a dog that he realli want for himself but sonni is afraid of dog becaus he wa bitten by one onc and ha been creep out ever sinc it s curious that when his father insist on get a dog sonni decid to run away from home rather than have a dog in the hous and a he is run away with no destin in sight it s also curious that the movi illustr what seem to be an indiffer to homeless peopl that surpass even the astound indiffer that exist today sonni pas a man cook bacon in an iron skillet at the side of the train track right after a train flew by which given how close to the track he wa you would think would have blown the guy right off the track but no matter after sonni give up on share breakfast due to the sour stare that his gleeful smile receiv from the guy he continu on and the homeless guy disappear from the movi it s interest to consid what a longer film would have done becaus this one leav this poor guy a a loo end not that that matter sonni soon hear a dog whine underneath a trestl a he pas over it and jump down to find a dog cover in burr it might seem trite that he immedi take the dog up and adopt it sinc he just left home becaus of his fear of dog but it seem to me that he just need to be remind not of his power over dog but of their lack of power over him a soon a he saw a dog in need he overcam his fear hey if that s all it take all i have to do is find a helpless spider and i m set it s a veri conveni movi in which everyth work out exact a it is suppos to but it s cute enough and enjoy enough and short enough a it were to still be a fun movi we alreadi don t expect an epic plot in a minut film but pardon my pup still pack in a substanti amount of stori and charact develop in it short run time and it also featur a fight scene at the end of the movi that must have made charli chaplin proud i am hard an expert of shirley templ s film but it s not hard to see how she becam the most famous child star of all time

i find i enjoy this show but the format need some work first off the good attribut i like how this show will take u through the day to day life of an addict becaus the produc have a knack at get the addict to show u how bad they ve allow their live to becom this is follow by an intervent which is then follow by an outcom intervent doesn t candi coat thing and sometim the outcom often short term due to the constraint of time between film and air is a negat outcom this make the posit outcom all the better anoth thing i like about the show is the qualiti of the camera work given the realiti that these cameraman have to squeez anywher and don t have the benefit of re shoot scene the photographi is surpris good and stabl it s actual superior to script show like the shield where the photographi is so bad it can induc nausea now for the bad an episod will sometim contain two complet differ and unrel case that will be mix togeth dure the show you ll get caught up in the stori of one addict then sudden you re thrown into the stori of anoth get caught up in that stori then sudden you re back to the first addict or are you by now you may have forgotten which case the individu current on screen belong to this constant flip flop between addict realli get disrupt dure the intervent scene becaus the show will even mix togeth the two complet unrel intervent i onc heard the market b s reason for this poor design the show can get so intens that switch to anoth addict allow the viewer time to absorb what they re watch oh plea clear the reason this is done is becaus they have two case that aren t big enough for an hour show so they mix two togeth by mix them instead of give each a half hour block like they should it forc the viewer to watch the entir thing and the commerci if they are interest in one case but not the other i use to find these blender episod so annoy that i d onli tell my tivo to record episod contain one addict but then it becam easier just to record all of them 
 
 
 
i wa on franc around march and i love to go to this film festiv i knew about this cin ma d am riqu latin de toulous but i ve never went to it i decid to go and then i caught cero y van the film is stun it doesn t caus the impact on me like with the mexican user becaus it wa french subtitl but it s still shock this film is a satir about urban violenc about kidnap and crime on the street in mexico it is a crude portrait of the citi of a metropoli secuestro express with a stun mia maestro which wa also a satir of kidnap almost but with a more serious tone ha and i think so some kinda connect with cero y van a sort of redempt stori and that how much is too much man on fire that wa stun strong wa also not a satir but a crude portrait into the street of mexico or it is like the brave one a film that shock and hit you in the gut veri hard this is like the usual suspect it ha some plot twist and turn but that make it even more believ verdict a film that shock and make you believ that there s no secur on the street anymor stun dialogu impress direct and astonish perform cero y van is a film that you won t forget soon leav you shake and stun 
 
 
 
this movi even though is about one of the most favorit topic of mexican produc produc the extrem life in our citi ha a funni way to put it on the screen four of the more import mexican director of the last time approach histori of our citi frame in diver literari sort a it can be the farc or the satir which give u a film with a over expo topic in our countri but narrat in a veri differ way which give a fresh tone him with actor littl known but that interpret of excel way their paper each one of the director reflect in the stori the capac by we have been identifi anywher in the world that capac of laugh the pain and to make celebr of the sad perhap to mani peopl in our countri the film not have plea but i consid that peopl of other countri could find attract and share the surreal of the mexican

when friendship kill in my opinion is a veri touch and kind of heartbreak drama about the consequ of be anorex or bulim anytim lexi kati wright or jennif marley shelton threw up i want to vomit myself it s kind of hard to explain whi if you ask me they should have been more cooper about thing howev i did enjoy see them do thing togeth a well a get lectur by their parent befor i wrap this up i d like to say if you ask me when friendship kill doe inde show you how be anorex or bulim can affect a person s bodi now in conclus i recommend this movi to everyon who hasn t seen it you re in for some tear and a good time so the next time it s on tv kick back with a friend and watch it 
 
 
 
i came across this film by accid when list all the film i want my sister to record for me whilst i wa on holiday and i am so glad that i includ this one it deal with issu that most director shi away from my onli problem with this film is that it wa made for tv so i couldn t buy a copi for my friend it s a touch stori about how peopl with eat disord don t necessarili shi away from everyon and how mani actual have diet buddi it brought to my attent that although bulim can maintain a fair stabl weight it ha more serious consequ on their health that mani peopl are ignor of 
 
 
 
i agre with the abov comment i love the realism in this and in mani movi not just movi on eat disord the produc seem to forget that they take an everi day problem and creat a huge dramat scene and then come the end of the movi everyth is perfect again which i dislik becaus it not realiti not mean to say thing can t get better and not mean to say thing don t in this movi but it doesn t spend most of the movi creat all these problem and come the end of the movi everyth is perfect again when peopl have eat disord peopl don t just admit it and want to get better and then life is peachi it take time and i like how in this movi we grow with the charact we go through the difficulti with them get better and wors becaus it is a veri import part of the movi it get into the mind of peopl with eat disord and show the complic and pain in a veri realist way and i love that i also love how it show the secreci and betray peopl feel when suffer from eat disord it is scari to see how peopl react when they find out especi if they approv of it i thought this movi wa veri touch and beauti and well told and defiant one of my favourit 
 
 
 
there are way too mani subject avoid in cinema and eat disord is one of them this film show it a it is it is not glamouris for the viewer to enjoy it is shown with real truth which make it all the more power i ve onli seen it onc and that wa a few year ago but i can still rememb everyth about it and how it made me feel it is a veri power film and is good support for anyon suffer from a eat disord to give them the willpow to stop this is what film should be about they should be there to help peopl and not glamouris thing that are wrong 
 
 
 
i have seen a coupl movi on eat disord but this one wa definit my favorit one the problem with the other one wa that the peopl with the eat disord toward the end just automat get better or accept the fact that they need help and that it this movi i thought wa more realist caus in this one the main charact lexi doesn t automat just get better she get better and then ha a drawback i think this movi show more than the other that i ve seen that get better doesn t just happen it s hard work and take time it s a long path to recoveri i think this movi show all of that veri well there should be more movi like this

mani of the review and comment i have read about this movi say that this is a rather stale film and perform by clara bow although the stori line wa rather typic of clara s later silent i still find it somewhat heart stir and incred fun clara play a happi go lucki hawaiian girl who will stop at noth to win the man she love never mind that this man is marri clara s lack of modesti wa shock in the day but i believ it lend to the sweet and general fun of the movi though definit not a brilliant stori line quit typic actual this movi is a nice showcas of clara s abil to make the audienc laugh 
 
 
 
there s a theori of time that posit that all the moment that ever exist and will exist actual exist right now it s a bit too much to wrap your head around but perhap a bit of a comfort to those who wish they could go back to a simpler time and place for barbara jean trenton ida lupino that time wa twenti five year earlier the mid s when her youth and glamor held the greatest promis for my part if i could travel through time it would be back to the s when i grew up mayb to a place like willoughbi but that s anoth episod one thing that wouldn t be so special about would involv deal with all that clunki machineri just to watch an episod of the twilight zone how mani reel do you think it would take to catalog the entir seri and then find a particular stori you want to watch i guess you have to consid the trade off conveni versus simplic have it right now or take the time to spool it up to the exact spot where the stori begin pop in a cd ha it s advantag i m a littl surpris that rod serl would pen a stori that so close resembl sunset boulevard ida lupino s charact mirror imag norma desmond just a bit too close to be consid an origin concept martin balsam portray veri much a similar charact to erich von stroheim the husband turn butler who s loyalti is unquest where the stori diverg ha to do with the way danni balsam and sall ted de corsia challeng barbara jean to get with realiti and clear the cobweb that paralyz her exist fortun for u viewer ida lupino had no such reserv about take part that were not big but a nice showcas it s a real treat to watch ani episod of the twilight zone and get to see who pop up from day gone by sometim you get a two fer like you have here with lupino and balsam celebr who sometim made their mark befor the seri began and sometim after combin with the stori that the program produc it s not surpris that they still manag to entertain so well today 
 
 
 
i found this movi realli funni becaus you have a youth black comedian chris rock who die and is sent back to earth in a mid s white man bodi he doesn t realiz that his behavior should chang and continu to act a he had befor he listen to rap music sing along and play the stereotyp part of an urban black man the real humor in this movi wa watch the troubl that this behavior get him into with the black communiti 
 
 
 
this wa a hilari movi and i would see it again and again it isn t a movi for someon who doesn t have a fun sen of a humor but for peopl who enoy comedi like chris rock it a perfect movi in my opinion it is realli funnny

chris rock star in this remak of warren beatti s heaven can wait itself a remak of the film here come mr jordan a comedi about a man who die befor his time befor he can realiz his dream and his adventur in his new albeit temporari bodi in the beatti version the protagonist wa a backup quarterback for the then los angel ram in rock s hipper version our lead charact is a struggl young and decid low talent standup comedian it s veri funni to see the razor sharp rock play a bad comedian it s kind of like see tom hank play a bad actor lanc barton s dream is to play the legendari apollo theater on a non amateur night but everi time he tri out his materi he s boo off the stage lustili so much so that his nicknam becom booie his joke are lame his deliveri pain in short lanc is everyth that the real chris rock isn t lanc is also a bike messeng and he s ride the street on his way to tri out even more materi when bam he s hit by a truck ok so mayb he wa taken from his bodi a tenth of a second earli by a slight incompet angel eugen levi but hey he wa go to get hit anyway no dice it appear lanc isn t due in heaven until so what to do mr king chazz palminteri the manag of heaven reluct agre to find a new bodi for the not quit dead mr barton troubl is the bodi they find is of a greedi old white man turn out this fella a mr wellington own all kind of thing he s the th richest man in the countri what luck you can imagin how lanc will turn thing around but of cours while in the bodi of the affluent mr wellington lanc fall for a gorgeous hospit worker regina king we male know how tough it is to find a femal given our own bodi but tri win one over while you re an dumpi old white guy and it s even wors when she s not impress by your money this is rock s first shot at a lead role and in my opinion he perform admir there s still a lot of the standup comedian in him and of cours if he ever want to get diver role he might have to stop incorpor standup routin into the script but this isn t realli a bad thing rock s person his drive his deliveri his demeanor and his passion are what fuel this film he s clear have a lot of fun in the role and he seem bent on make sure you have fun watch him 
 
 
 
this is such a great film never mind the low rate here i realli have no idea where that came from they must be discus a differ film then becaus i absolut love it and found it to be a littl hidden treasur it s stori wa so origin and charm i realli can t think of anyth bad to say about it mayb it ha to be your type of thing but i saw this with my sister and my mother and we all were taken by it the act wa also veri good and that is hard to do in a film like this but i found all the charact veri intrigu and sympathet i ve alway been veri fond of dougray scott and found his new dark role veri interest it is realli aw hard to get me to like a bad guy but i absolut had no problem with that this time even more so i ador him everyon who love a good thriller drama that also ha a good dose of love and tragedi should definit go see this film no question about that anyon want to see a film with bloodsh should go rent someth el though but i guess the titl alreadi kind of give that away this is a love stori not saw i give this film out of five star good job xxx enjoy 
 
 
 
i have seen this movi a whole dozen time and it s awesom but the onli thing with it wa that in the begin there wa too much talk of who s go out with who i think that it would be interest to do a remak of it but on the offici site they said that they will not be make a remak of it becaus so mani peopl have gotten save when view it what s even happen to patti dun now she is a pretti good actress she ha done sever other movi in the s and s but we haven t heard from her sinc i know for sure about thom rachford who play jerri work for account at rd film but overal i have to say that the seri itself is like left behind gone old school 
 
 
 
stylish moodi innov reveng driven bloodbath also cheesi of cours and sporad veri cheesi it remind me a lot of the big heat becaus it ha the reveng plot set off by the exact same event and the girl come around to the good guy s side becaus of the same bad behavior by the bad guy it s sad there s no gloria graham but so fantast that it s alain delon and not glenn ford could there be anyon a beauti a alain go around in a cashmer sweater and trenchcoat yet he s total tough and ici cool no one nowaday can touch him though someon like jude law could tri i guess hard for ani girl to look good with him the music wa funki and perfect and there were sever excel car chase and those aren t general my cup of tea especi one willi nilli one in the wood peopl also met their doom in creativ and bloodi fashion for instanc in a junkyard cruncher but beyond the chees the overal atmospher wa affect and expert pull off more creativ excit and fresh in that forgotten movi than most of what i ve seen late 
 
 
 
i ve read most of the comment on this movi i have seen this movi and the whole propheci seri mani time with famili member of all age we all enjoy and it just made u medit on what we alreadi knew from read and studi the bibl about the raptur and end time no one got scare or traumat like i have read on some post the movi is just base on biblic fact i have seen a lot of end time movi tribul armagedon and so on and by far this one is one of the best in present bibl truth it may not have a lot of great special effect like today movi but i believ it is a good wit tool this movi and it propheci seri can be seen free at this websit higherprais com and judg for yourself bless to all 
 
 
 
a thief in the night ha got to be the best out of all the end time thriller i have no clue what peopl are complain about what peopl are whine about when they say that these movi scare them into accept god they just need to find an excus and blame a thief in the night do not listen these movi do not onli tell of one of the mani possibl of the tribul but they re also fun to watch in their simplic they are in fact low budget and that is a littl obvious but not all too obvious upon first view i had no clue becaus i realli assum that a lot of movi like these made in the s includ low budget all the time a thief in the night tell the stori of young and cynic patti myer who live for what come her way until her husband and near all her friend disappear in the prophet raptur everyon warn her about at first the movi isn t all base around her until the raptur happen what it lead up to are show that everyon el around her are becom christian and believ in christ which is usual what happen to a lot of peopl everyon around them they onc knew and love will be gone forev and the one who is left behind is the one who blame everyon but themselv no one can ever blame themselv becaus they re alway right just like these whiner who complain about the movi these peopl must be full grown adult i m thirteen and you don t see me whine especi sinc i wa exact like patti befor i re accept christ into my heart for those who haven t seen it if you want a littl bit of everyth toss into a christian movi instead of stereo typic everyon el is wrong movi than you ll enjoy a thief in the night don t knock it befor you tri it someth new is alway good trust your own instinct 
 
 
 
obvious there wasn t a huge budget for this film which definit hinder the product but the stori and end were so brutal that they made up for a lot i mean brutal on the level of ju dou and other great chine film i first saw this when i wa year old i ran home and beg god to forgiv me for everyth 
 
 
 
to all the review on this page i would have to say this movi is worth see so it wa made in so what the fashion in the movi wa exact the same fashion of it time peopl who didn t studi cultur of the decad would think that this movi is a chees ball compar to the modern seri `left behind which is made for our time right now it doe look cheezi howev the onli cheezi part of the movi is the fashion which again wa over year in the past but the messag that is sent in this film is veri power and care preserv there is just so much to say but i refus to say it for fear of spoil it so go out and see this film if you don t like the messag that it send then you have issu that need some attent 
 
 
 
i rememb see this movi a long time ago back then even though it didn t have ani special effect the act wa realli good and it still ha the same messag for today even though the technolog ha chang mayb they should make a remak of this movi it would be interest to see a remak i also enjoy the music from the movi a well larri norman wa a realli good songwrit dure that time period although now most christian music is now worship and prais music i wa alway curious to know what ever happen to patti after the seri end did she go on to make more movi did she get eventu get marri and rais a famili i would like to have an updat 
 
 
 
the reason whi peopl say that this movi scare them is becaus it did that mean the movi purpos wa felt by a few who did see it when i first saw this movi it scare me and made me think about life and religion this is not a blood and gore scari type movi but the kind that you would think that it may be possibl for thing to happen the way the movi wa written of cours non believ will say it onli a sci fi movi truth is this movi is a must have for your thriller collect even if it doe have a religi view if you are a fan of classic thriller omen etc this is one of them and it a must have i never saw the sequel distant thunder but i believ it pick up where this movi end 
 
 
 
night of the live homeless is a funni spoof of the film and the remak of dawn of the dead onli this time with the homeless the episod ha homeless peopl all come to south park and the peopl cannot figur out whi they treat the homeless like zombi who want chang and a few of the parent end up on the roof of a supermarket like in the movi so now it s up to the boy to find out where they came from and how to get rid of them this is a fair funni episod with some good moment like the boy sing their own version of the pac dr dre song california love overal a good episod 
 
 
 
long befor tim lahay and jerri b jenkin would shake the world of the christian subcultur and make million in the process with the left behind book mark iv pictur the christian film distribut compani of the billi graham evangelist associ gave u this masterwork what i love most about this genr is it incred attent to detail sit in a live room instead of take u to the dramat scene of this post raptur tribul we sit in the live room hear about it on the news becaus the filmmak can t afford to show it the film s premis is ground in pre milleni pre tribul eschatalog believ that christ come onc for the secret take of the true church and then come again at the end of the seven year of hell on earth what use to terrifi me in junior high now make me laugh the intrigu adventur of patti and her journey throughout the tribul and two of the film s three sequel tell her remark stori of unbelief and ultim damnat i hate to admit it but i still thorough enjoy watch this it even ha the same exact score of monti python and the holi grail i think i m the onli person in histori to make that observ

there are two thing that i like about elvira and they re both bigger than she is and she keep them cover up her wit and her talent a movi is the best thing to show off how funni she can be or how she command attent look like a combin clone of morticia adam and anna nicol smith she inherit a distant relat s estat onli to discov that she is realli the heiress of the occult the comedi in this movi is the best thing about it but it could have been a lot more scari and chill it s most a campi fare with a mani bad horror movi refer in it such a the riot mob or the flee heroin who trip and stumbl on her heel my favorit part is when she use her marvel endow to break the chain keep her lock in the cemetari the end is sap sweet a if it were written by the bradi but the la vega act at the end seem too grandios for this type of movi

i still like it though warren beatti is onli fair a the comic book hero what save this movi is the set the incred cast and it offshoot a mediocr script i realli expect someth more substanti in the term of action or plot but i got veri littl the main reason to watch this movi is to watch some of the biggest star in hollywood at the time in such an unusu film the one person who did a terribl job and did not even belong in this film wa madonna she did not belong in this movi and her act job wa pretti bad the movi at some point just stood still you expect someth more and you got noth al pacino play a realli bad dude and he doe pretti good he and beatti do make an excel good guy and bad guy it is also interest to see dustin hoffman and warren beatti in a film other than isthar i did not see ishtar but i heard bad thing the thing about this movi is it is good but it could have been so much better i like it a a child becaus i thought it look cool and visual the movi is amaz the set are incred the write is onli fair and with such a cast in the movi i would expect a littl better anyway spoiler i especi thought the final wa not big enough it wa interest but for such a grand scale film i just thought it could have end with a littl more of a bang the reason to watch this movi is the atmospher the movi onli use the comic book color make it all that more excel visual anyway the costum and makeup were flawless a well the facial makeup for the villain wa great beatti is just not up to such a bigger than life charact still this is a good movi that could have been much much more it is to me better than batman the other comic book adapt that came out close to the same time of cours that movi wa much bigger in term of gross 
 
 
 
dick traci wa origin a comic book creat in by chester gould he is a plaincloth detect who track down a crew of villain rang from all type of visual origin charact such a flattop to the blank to big boy capric these villain becam so popular in the s that warner bros creat their own take on the traci style villain in such cartoon a daffi duck traci s comic were known for their liber use of gunplay and the up to date technolog advanc notabl the wristwatch communic which got their fair share of screen time on this excel movi the music wa done wonder by danni elfman and the origin song by madonna were interest but they were not the high point for her career it s weird becaus a you watch the film and see the suspens moment the film feel so much like batman becaus of elfman s memor sound to his piec i love the tough talk kid pacino s act a big boy capric and that chin madonna s take on villaini and the cinematographi and direct were impecc this film wa veri profession made and featur ton of great actor who were known a great actor for a while befor this film wa made warren beatti al pacino william forsyth dustin hoffman kathi bate mandi patinkin catherin o hara dick van dyke the film wa direct by beatti himself which wa interest it is almost like beatti saw himself a traci in a past life or someth becaus he realli fit the part i had to give this film an for everyth that it brought to cinema that got overlook for whatev reason there have been ton of misunderstand over the rate of this movi on imdb and i still don t understand whi the charact were complet origin and vibrant a wa the style of the set wardrob light and everyth in this film go buy it today you will not be sorri 
 
 
 
this movi is the best movi to watch for comic book feel the set costum and the color are just so vivid it is just like step into a comic book this is the movi i think of when the mob is mention the suit the hat and the attitud hoffman give comic relief a mumbl and you can t help but feel sorri for madonna a she tri and fail to win traci over this movi contain all the classic mob clich s buri peopl in concret blow up peopl car tie up the good guy and attempt to blow up his girlfriend hous this movi is a classic in ever sen of the word even camera angel cri out comic book it so great to be abl to go back to an older movi and see that someon knew how a comic should be made into a movi after see such mistak a spawn and the hulk you have to see this movi 
 
 
 
that wa great fun i never read those chester gould comic but it s not necessari to know them mayb there were some insid joke i didn t figur out but what the eye doesn t see the heart cannot griev over this is such an iron colour film and the actor are good humour all togeth the set is similar to that in the batman` movi but not a dark and grey okay the stori is not so origin but there is a plot which is not self evid and a more or le surpris end with this movi you could play an interest game if you watch it with friend don t watch the credit at the begin and then look who s the fastest to find out who are the famous actor under their make up 
 
 
 
i saw dick traci when i wa veri young i didn t know who ani of the actor were and i didn t know the movi would turn out differ than the way it wa preview i sure love it though warren beatti star a the crime fight s detect dick traci who goe after the biggest mob bos in the citi this time big boy capric al pacino ha kill a veri power man and is out to take over the citi with his singer girlfriend breathless mahoney madonna who ha her eye on traci it becom even wors becaus a new crimin is invad and the worst part is this crimin ha no face he or she is veri unknown plus the famous villian are back from the comic book collect i thought that this movi wa veri color and creativ it wa entertain and fun to watch especi a a child warren beati wa just like jame bond of the s the way he play dick traci an ensembl cast of the film includ charli korsmo glenn head william forsyth dustin hoffman jame caan ed o ross tommi lee jone mandi patinkin charl durn plus more dick traci is a movi for all age and is a fun movi for a famili to enjoy take my word for it 
 
 
 
most success comic book movi usual depend on have villain that are bigger than life readi to jump off the screen and strangl you aliv with a smile or a dement line or two of dialog the tim burton batman had it a did in an even more grotesqu manner sin citi with dick traci produc director star warren beatti pile on the villain until it becom part of the framework like a boister homag to s gangster pictur onli this time meant for kid a oppos to the darker bonni and clyde dick traci is fill joy with archetyp and bright primari color where the crimin carri tommi gun and are form on their face to shape their person villain like the stoog shoulder lip the brow mumbl the blank prunefac spud chester gould gave the name to his charact that fit their profil and gave his hero a jaw that could cut glass the film is a continu of sight gag that are perfect taken serious if at the time movi like batman and underr teenag mutant ninja turtl were darker depict of realiti within a comic book outlin dick traci is more old school it s a stori of cop and crook or rather a cop detect traci a he tri to bust big boy al pacino in what is arguabl his biggest perform to date and in a sen the one that make sen for his grandios style but with no such luck there s also a littl kid call simpli the kid charli korsmo who somehow bring more spunk to this littl kid than would ve been imagin and traci s love interest in te and then there s the nightclub dame madonna who probabl doesn t give ani kind of great act perform but mayb that suit the role fine and she sing excel when call upon who wont testifi unless traci admit feel he doesn t have for her then there s convolut deal with take traci down and a mysteri mask figur with a scragg voic meantim a if do an imperson of a howard hawk film in a splash of visual effect and bigger explos dick traci add on the wink and nod comedi and the action like it syrup on a tall stack of pancak it s a wonder to look at this world which is creat in way that have a fascin to them that had they been done today would just be simpli by proxi of comput i e sin citi which can be justifi compar to beatti s film we re driven through this world in great big shot and then thrust in the plot line or whatev there is of it in big edit montag with camera angl that seem to come out of those littl tilt panel in the comic of old i m almost remind of the cotton club dure these sequenc a stori music detail and a few big punch and gun shot go a long way to reveal what need to be said which actual isn t more than it need to and there s a heap load of catchi dialog from the script one of my favorit the enemi of my enemi is my enemi plus ani of pacino s refer to other figur in quot revisit this after see it for the first time in the movi theater and onli rememb littl bit dick traci is a hard boil fantasi to the finest degre it s fill with good cheer for the kid and with some pretti good action squar away without some of the more sinist intent of it cousin comic book movi i e pg fare and for the adult it throw back central done with panach and a solid feel for the unsubtl even dustin hoffman ham it up and he bare say an audibl word

if you like gangster type of movi then this is the first one you should buy or at least rent al pacino his perform is top notch and the stori is classic whi isn t this movi in the top list 
 
 
 
this is one of my favorit film of all time al pacino act is at it best and the stori is excel too bad it didn t do to well in the s when it wa first releas becaus peopl didn t get a chanc to experi this classic 
 
 
 
 a classic is someth that everybodi want to have read but nobodi want to read a classic is also someth that everyon prais but no one ha read mark twain classic seem to be the word use to describ scarfac brian depalma s film about opul self surrend greed and danger among florida s drug ring peopl and critic and rapper for that matter deem this film an epic gangster classic or eptiom of gangster film when it is anyth but it is prais for all the wrong reason scarfac is a terrif film that deserv prais from all over but not all the prais it get from audienc today and therefor the fine point it so poignant make are miss by the general public first off the film is about a cuban refuge with a past of want to escap communism grasp and find happi simpl yes but the layer of de palma s direct genius and the great stori written by oliv stone yes i know he actual wrote a real good one here play into all of it the charact are all look for an escap a escap is a natur element dealt with in the film by all each charact ha someth to offer that make them likabl by everyon who could appreci this film they are entwin in a world of mystiqu and money but all that ha a price a they all learn each charact think they are get better chanc in life when in true dramat ironi they are actual get wors tragedi would be a better word to describ this movi all those who prais the film for it s drug usag it s violenc it s dialog total miss the point there is noth realli posit about the film besid the charact posit expect of themselv and that is whi the film work so well the devast through out the film serv to deliv the messag of the film not to look cool or attract viewer brian de palma doesn t make movi for cult gangster or brainless action fan next on the film is an adult drama it is not a gangster film it ha it s share of action but the action is plot veri care so it ha a point it s not like alien an exampl of a big dumb action film and most audienc perceiv this film a a big dumb action gangster film about do drug and shoot peopl ridicul hogwash if this film is about that then it is about how bad it is not a promot of it this be said the film is inde a great film it ha great cinematographi that pull you into the stori it ha a veri dramat score in true giorgio morod style which simpli could give you chill or bring you to tear the film is rather lengthi but it is a stori and each moment count the act is terrif al pacino enough said he can do ani role that he put his mind to and this wa no except pretti boy steven bauer a manni i didn t think much of him in other film he did but he actual make you like him when he goe under maestro de palma s direct michell pfeiffer is a true gem a elvira pop fresh off the heel of a sort of embarrass in greas she got her ticket to ride perform a no hold bar perform of a beauti that is more than meet the eye but the three true diamond in this rough are mari elizabeth mastrontonio a toni s sister gina who when she smile or cri we see her soul and her fresh way of live and watch it deterior paul shenar a alejandro sosa a drug lord who run deeper than a river and shenar portray him a so and miriam colom a toni and gina s torn mother these three dig the film a deep a it can go this review learn one main thing when watch scarfac for the first time alway go into a film unsuspect all the hype and talk of this film cannot possibl prepar you for what you realli see onli know de palma like i do can give you even a glimps of what this film hold so ignor the rap crap ignor the mindless violenc support and fix yourself a glass of bailey s on the rock and indulg yourself in an emot view of a great film the real scarfac 
 
 
 
this is one of my all time favorit if the movi ha a flaw it s that it come at you like a rage bull it doesn t so much engag the viewer a assault him scarfac is a voraci and unyield a product a toni montana himself noth is left to the viewer s imagin morod s languor synthpop fit the action to a tee like the chorus in a greek tragedi it wail and gnash brood and tug a constant remind of toni s inexor fate not so much a tale of caution a a disast in progress scarfac rip across the screen with the unstopp forc of a runaway train 
 
 
 
i saw this movi about a week ago and still keep think about it i wa veri move by this movi i found the charact veri believ and likabl almost to a fault a in real life though sometim peopl disappoint a wa the case with leo who even though i like his charact i could not have been more disappoint when he wa will to have unprotect sex even though fulli awar of his hiv status i wa also disappoint with leo for reject the medicin avail to him and the aw way he treat marcel when he decid to ship him back home on the train i think this movi show in a veri real way whi hiv number are up in young gay men this is in no way meant to bash gay i am gay and movi veri well could have been made about a young straight person who make bad choic and seem unawar of the consequ to himself and other the onli part of the movi i couldn t understand wa whi the gay friend famili wa unwil to includ marcel in leo s ill to the point of not allow him to go to the funer i think the biggest messag from this movi is that whether gay or straight is do not have unprotect sex 
 
 
 
i found this film to be a fascin studi of a famili in crisi when leo the oldest announc that he is hiv the reaction of the famili member alon and with each other wa touch and yet strang i have never seen a famili that wa a physic demonstr a this one nor one a like to shout at each other i didn t understand whi the famili felt that youngest couldn t deal with the news but onc past that difficult i found this a thorough move film 
 
 
 
this film made for french tv deal with the tragic effect it ha for a close knit famili when leo the young man at the center of the stori is diagnos a have the aid virus announc it to his parent they just can t believ it the film is a charact studi on how this famili deal with it subject the director christoph honor ha to be congratul for bring this frank account to the screen nowher but in franc could this stori make it to the movi becaus of the subject matter the news ha a devast effect on marcel the young brother who hear about what leo ha contract in spite of the way the parent want to shelter him from realiti yaniss lespart and pierr mignard do a convinc job in portray the brother 
 
 
 
it wa veri heart warm a an expatri french i particular enjoy this tv movi which i think deserv a broader distribut the act wa good and the bond between each member of this rural french famili seem so strong and so natur no doubt a great movi about the concept of famili and inclus in the face of homosexu and aid one of the strongest aspect of the movi is this privileg relationship between the eldest son leo who ha contract hiv and the youngest son marcel to whom the rest of the famili tri to hide the situat the two charact progress explor each other a time run out for leo who is not will to spend the rest of his life surviv under drug

one of disney s best film that i can enjoy watch often you may easili guess the outcom but who care it just plain fun escap for hour forti two minut and after all wasn t movi meant to get away from realiti for just a short time anyway the cast sparkl with delight magictrain
 
 
 
i have to say despit it s review angel in the outfield wa a pretti good movi i like the fact how it teach kid to alway have faith and never give up becaus yes miracl can happen unlik the other basebal movi this one particular movi stood out becaus of hit amaz special effect and well orchestr soundtrack which wa veri interest though i like this movi it did have some flaw such a some irrelev i e toward the end when ray mitchel hit a homer he doesn t step on the plate and therefor that wouldn t be a score but that s just nitpick i have to say i wa realli impress with this movi s presenc and moral just have faith don t give up 
 
 
 
one piec of trivia that is often forgotten about this famili film is one of busi at the time in this movi held the record for the biggest movi premier in motion pictur histori and may continu to hold it wa held in pittsburgh pennsylvania no doubt in honor of the origin film s angel who haunt the pittsburgh pirat in this remak they haunt the california angel anyway the premier wa held at the long gone three river stadium which wa the home of the pittsburgh pirat and the pittsburgh steeler at the time the pirat are now hous in pnc park and the steeler at heinz field the premier wa held on a movi screen that wa five stori in height insid the stadium and held and may even continu to hold the record for the largest movi premier in histori shown to fan danni glover toni danza and christoph lloyd were all in attend to the admir of thousand of sport fan 
 
 
 
i enjoy movi like this for their spirit no pun intend it a decent clean movi about a basebal team that s fall behind and a young fan wish for them to win sinc his deadbeat dad said that wa the onli way he d come back for him the spirit shine through in two way a funni cast with danni glover and a young joseph gordon levitt and the heaven herald al take the dynam form of christoph lloyd it an energet movi it get you smile and realli involv you in the sport therein lie my gripe the one thing that kinda bug me is these sport movi that kind of turn you into an unexpect fan for the team there s absolut noth wrong with that i just find it odd that i should come away from the movi think the angel are a strong cool team when realli my base loyalti such a it is lie with the toronto blue jay it s interest realli if it s just a movi about an underdog kid team then it okay 
 
 
 
i have alway like this great basebal movi it ha a good cast includ two tremend actor and two of my favorit danni glover and christoph lloyd also in this movi is ben johnson brenda fricker big toni longo toni danza and matthew mcconaughey also jay o sander and dermot mulroney the film ha great special effect and act from all of the film s actor the basebal scene are all realist the music by compos randi edelman is veri good and it fit the film veri well some of the actor who remind me the actual basebal person stoney jackson s ray mitchel charact remind me royc clayton mcconaughey s charact remind me of steve finley and jay o sander s comment in my opinion resembl how al hraboski look today this is a fantast movi for non and basebal fan and i strong recommend this film 
 
 
 
the memori of the the last hunt ha stuck with me sinc i saw it in when i wa it is a movi that wa far ahead of other at the time in that it address the treatment of the nativ the environ and the ever present contrast between the short and long term effect of greed it is a relev today a in a cinemagraph discus of utmost depth and relev to top it off the set is beauti and the cinematographi excel the memori of this movi will be with me to the end of my day 
 
 
 
 scarlett johansson woodi allen hugh jackman ian mcshane romola garia direct by woodi allen just after his work with johansson on match point the two return for scoop a corki zani and fun comic ride when a student report johansson find out a new scoop from a deceas report mcshane when she enter the materi of a lame magician allen the scoop be of the new tarot card killer in london who might be preppi peter lyman jackman while sondra and sid are play detect sondra fall in love for the handsom would be killer allen ha final hit a mark not a good a match point but definit more fun i laugh a lot more than i expect one of the year must sees
 
 
 
 match point and now scoop have both convinc me that not onli is woodi allen do a neat job make movi in england and that scarlett johansson is the right cast member but corrobor what i have known for year he shouldn t focus on neurot rich new yorker in this case johansson play journal student sondra pranski whom magician sid waterman allen put in his disappear box where she meet the ghost of murder report joe strombel ian mcshane who tell her that the serial kill that have plagu london were commit by millionair peter lyman hugh jackman so she get to know him and well i don t know how much i can tell you without give it away but i can say that this is probabl allen s funniest movi in year there s his ubiquit uniqu style of humor especi the line about his religion so you re sure to like this movi if noth el it ll make you fall in love with london but most it s just so damn hilari even if you don t like woodi allen you gotta love this one 
 
 
 
woodi allen s second movi set in london tha tarot card murder is kill prostitut in london aspir journalist sondra pranski scarlett johansson get a tip that he may be lord peter lyman hugh jackman she start to romanc him but quick fall in love she s help by stage magician sid waterman woodi allen who doesn t like what he see i like this better than the over rate match point from last year it wa shorter and move much more quick the plot is old but i wa entertain and it kept me guess till the veri end it s not realli a comedi but a mysteri with a few veri good comed line all from allen of cours it s not one of allen s best but it s far better than his worst the act is for the most part veri good allen is bad but he s play this charact a million time befor and it s gotten tiresom but johansson and jackman are just great they look fantast and give two veri appeal believ perform also allen surpris work on their sex appeal there is a sequenc where they re both in the their bath suit to show off their nice bodi the onli real debit is that allen still seem unsur on how to shot london he s not a off a he wa on match point though mayb he ll just get better a he goe along worth see i give it an 
 
 
 
the film larg focus on a bulli robert taylor a a ruthless buffalo hunter and the peopl who have to put up with him set amidst a hunt for dwindl number of buffalo it portray the end of a tragic era of senseless slaughter and is full of drama and remors for both the buffalo and the nativ american taylor is blind by his hatr of indian and his naivet that the buffalo herd will never disappear in one scene he shoot anim after anim while in anoth he murder indian and then eat the food they had cook on their fire under this ruthless exterior lie an insecur person who is reduc to beg his comrad stewart granger lloyd nolan and rus tamblyn not to leav him it s not the most pleasant of film and is weigh down by the drama it creat lead to a dismal and veri fit conclus in a blizzard

i thought this wa a wonder way to spend time on a too hot summer weekend sit in the air condit theater and watch a light heart comedi the plot is simplist but the dialogu is witti and the charact are likabl even the well bread suspect serial killer while some may be disappoint when they realiz this is not match point risk addict i thought it wa proof that woodi allen is still fulli in control of the style mani of u have grown to love this wa the most i d laugh at one of woodi s comedi in year dare i say a decad while i ve never been impress with scarlet johanson in this she manag to tone down her sexi imag and jump right into a averag but spirit young woman this may not be the crown jewel of his career but it wa wittier than devil wear prada and more interest than superman a great comedi to go see with friend 
 
 
 
i wa lucki enough to get a free pas to an advanc screen of scoop last night full hous at the theatr and when the movi end there wa spontan applaus i didn t speak to anyon who dislik scoop although two teenag sit next to me sigh and fidget uncomfort for most of the film they were the except though becaus everyon el includ myself realli enjoy themselv scoop is a quick pace murder mysteri a young femal journal student is unwit maneuv by forc beyond her control into tri to catch a serial killer on the loo plenti of hijink ensu a she partner up with a travel illusionist and fall in love with a friski and charm young nobleman scoop isn t a bad addit to the woodi allen filmographi it isn t his best work but it is a veri enjoy and light heart romp i d say it fit quit comfort into be an averag woodi allen film right in the middl of the pack if you re a woodi allen fan you ll probabl enjoy yourself if you re indiffer to his work then scoop might be enough to get you interest in see more i don t think that anyon who dislik his style of film make and act are go to chang their mind woodi play the same kind of neurot charact we ve grown so accustom to although it border danger close to forc and over the top in this film while potenti aggrav for some who might find themselv wish he d hurri up and just spit out the word woodi allen fan know what to expect veri good perform all around in my opinion although i found myself miss ian mcshane who is excel and not on camera near enough hugh jackman is great a the charm nobleman and i think woodi allen ha found a new regular star to work with in scarlett johansson i think that with match point this is their second pair and she s just magic with the materi that woodi give her could be the begin of a beauti relationship i m glad i saw the movi and definit recommend it more sophist comedi than movi like scari movi so if your brand of comedi is the latter rather than the former scoop probabl isn t for you if on the other hand you like a touch of class sophist and fun scoop is for you probabl not the woodi allen film i d introduc to a newcom but all other should give it a tri 
 
 
 
read a wide varieti of scoop review over the past few day i walk into the theater prepar for a subpar outing from woodi happili i couldn t have been more wrong grant woodi the perform is slow down a touch or two but woodi the writer director is in fine form and found a credibl way to integr his year old self into the stori judg from the laughter and guffaw the audienc ate up allen s one liner and dialogu in a way that i haven t seen in sever year in a movi landscap domin by softwar approv stori arc twentysometh tast and assembl line formula fare for kiddi it s a sourc of both satisfact and inspir to see allen pursu his high person and still reward path 
 
 
 
i don t know if this is a sitcom or not but i agre that this is one of the greatest televis show ever it s great that this show still air and i love michell it s cute on the episod when she wa a babi and she talk and she sometim said someth funni aw this show can relat to child and teen and well famili a they struggl through rough time and tri to work it out a a famili i don t know who would ever turn down an opportun to watch this show with someon i love the episod when i think her name is dd the older girl accident stole a sweatshirt and she learn a lesson about steal that wa a great episod an exampl that this tv show show the famili work thing out a a famili i recommend this show for everyon 
 
 
 
i love this show grow up and i still watch the first season dvd at age today what can i say i grew up in a hous much like the one on full hous i had a dad two sister and a dog i guess the onli differ wa that i did not live with my uncl and my dad s best friend also i grew up with my mom in the hous i don t know what i would have done without full hous on televis i think that stephani play by jodi sweetin d j play by kirk cameron s sister candac and michell play by mari kate and ashley olsen are my favorit charact i can relat to each of them becaus i am the middl child of my famili like steph i am a younger sister like michell and i am an older sister like d j i realli like how the show alway ha moral valu becaus i don t realli like ani of the o c like show today i like the comedi of full hous too uncl jess john stamo joey dave coulier and danni bob saget are hilari a the girl uncl dad s friend and dad respect the stori goe that after the girl mom die danni s best friend joey and his brother in law jess move in to help rais the kid three men tri to rais three young girl hilari each charact on full hous is full of heart funni and genuin believ joey is an aspir comedian with a kid s heart and soul jess is the cool motorcycl ride tough guy uncl who is soften by his three niec and later his wife becki lauri laughlin from summervill both kid and adult will love this show guarante 
 
 
 
i had watch sever day film shoot of this movi that summer the end result wa just two scene in the movi the locat wa sylvan lake in the black hill bring the wagon stop the wagon etc so this dakota youth look forward to see the movi and wa not disappoint the local buffalo herd wa be cull so the shoot scene were for real yes dori anim were hurt dure film i think the end wa copi by jack nicholson in the shine a great western social comment from the s this should be in the same class a high noon for real western drama or use a a social statement like blackboard jungl or rebel without a caus wa for s youth 
 
 
 
full hous came to me when i wa about i rememb see re run of america s funniest home video with bob saget and one day my mom told me that he wa also in a show call full hous one day i wa lucki enough to catch an episod while visit famili it didn t seem too interest at first but a i watch more and more ever night at i would just be so into it this show realli make you want to be there yourself hang out with the girl go place with them and mayb even join in their littl famili sing along the thing i like most about full hous is that it s a great show for kid and adult of all age there will be some part that are more for adult then part that are meant for kid so that the whole famili will enjoy it no matter how cheesi it can be it s still a great show and i would definit recommend it to anyon 
 
 
 
i think the comment regard the show be cheesi are a bit too exagger when a person come to watch a tv show what doe he look out for it is to enjoy that he watch a show unless he she is a critic or a person who analyz stori but most of u are not so and watch the show to relax and enjoy full hous is an ideal show to watch after have a heavi day in the offic school it make you laugh and it is not just humor yes the tanner famili is a perfect famili a perfect hypothet famili if ani such famili exist in real world it would be a role model for u to follow but this is a tv show and not a real famili and there is noth wrong in depict a hypothet famili on televis the veri fact that the show could run so long show u that peopl enjoy watch it whatev be the comment later on anoth good point about the show is that ani person of ani age would not onli enjoy watch it but would take back a messag howev childish that messag be those jess s talk with michell are extrem touch if one doesn t think of it a childish overal i would say after watch everi show of full hous there is a content in your heart that is rare present after mani other show

like most other review i have first seen this movi on tv never on the big screen when i wa a teenag my dad ha alway regard this film high and recommend it to me then and i must say he wa not onli right but this movi ha stay with me forev in the more than decad sinc i saw it first time i have seen it two or three more time sinc then just a few day ago i gave it anoth watch and it ha not lost anyth of it impact with time it still a great and well worth to be seen movi manr regard peckinpah s ride the high countri a one of the first and best later western which had a realist look at life in the old west but the hard known last hunt is definit the better movi and wa even half a dozen year earlier actual it wa probabl decad ahead of it time or mayb it still is although think hard and have certain seen s of western i like this genr i can not rememb ani western a bleak and depress a this one two men bound togeth part by hate part by not seem to have other choic surround by beauti m padget a crippl old man and a young inian lead the life of buffalo killer until fate reach out for one of them nobodi who ha ever seen this movi will be abl to forget it end and the last frame of this gem when the camera move on and away from mr taylor a white buffalo skin come into sight on a tree and echo from the past when all the hatr began are present again mr taylor ha got his buffalo but in the end the buffalo got him asid from the top perform of everybodi involv the intellig script and the great dialogu it should also be mention that the last hunt is superbl photograp i have seldom seen a western that well shot asid from the one direct by anthoni mann which are also all superbl photograph that all the locat are clever chosen and that even the soundtrack fit the pictur veri well and director brook is realli a superb storytel master craftsmanship he ha made quit a coupl of realli great movi and wa success in near everi imagin genr but even in an a prolif career a this one the last hunt still shine a one of his best if not his best definit would deserv a higher rate compar to the someth ride the high countri enjoy 
 
 
 
ahh talespin what can i say that hasn t alreadi been said about this great show noth this is without a doubt one of the most well written show i ve ever encount live action or anim the newer stuff is way too dumb down for my tast and some of the matur stuff i have to shoo kid out of the room for but not talespin the stori are engag and veri plausibl some of them could even be stretch out to an hour or two for a movi episod like stormi weather and her chanc to dream are veri dramat while still be enjoy for kid and adult alik then there are the pure comedi episod such a the bluest of the baloo blood and stuck on you where the emphasi is on hilar i can laugh myself to tear in a few choic one the drama aspect is veri lack in most show nowaday at least those which aren t specif gear toward it especi in cartoon in the episod stormi weather for instanc kit cloudkick decid that he s go to join an air circus but baloo believ that it would be too danger in the biggest fight of the episod baloo yell at kit to stay away from dare dan to which kit scream no you can t tell me what to do your re not my dad and buri his face in his pillow the next day he leav for the air circus this kind of drama is a rariti in a cartoon and would be most welcom in the one creat nowaday the charact have a lot of depth to them baloo is pretti much the way he is in the jungl book plus or minus a few degre of lazi rebecca is a cun busi woman whose idea on get money while good in theori are seldom good in practic molli is a cute littl girl but you can t let that deceiv you she can be a real hellion sometim kit cloudkick is a darker charact than the rest he doesn t trust adult much unless they appeal to him and he ha a tendenc to break off relationship watch his express in plunder and lightn when he grab the grappl hook he look a though he s prepar to put it right through a pirat in the end it s the drama combin with the veri real chemistri between the charact that make this show in my book the relationship between baloo and kit is veri real almost father and son this is demonstr well in all s whale that end whale when baloo take kit s word for it that seymour is abus the anim in his aquarium instead of side with the other adult baloo and becki s relationship is also realist due to baloo s motiv for work come from want to buy back the ol sea duck not necessarili a desir to help rebecca but someth tell me that if he did get the duck back he d still do job for rebecca the sea duck not to mention all the other plane in the seri is pretti realist design the plane s function don t chang onc throughout the seri continu like that is hard to come by also and unlik most other super plane of other cartoon it doesn t have one singl weapon on board unless you count mango and reli instead on it s cun pilot s great skill to get out of troubl it s hard to think of a hero vehicl that doesn t have some sort of gun turret laser cannon or even a handgun somewher on board and the fact that they use their head to get out of troubl is so hard to find in a cartoon nowaday plus it s just such a darn cool design this is definit the best cartoon ever period definit worth all ten star

the best way for me to describ europa which is high on the list of my favourit film is the exclam that came from a companion after the film end i didn t know film could be made like that entir origin in it s visual style it is one of the best exampl of what cinema can be it s a far away from the master and coverag style of shoot a one can get perfect integr mani layer of imag sound effect prop dialogu voic over perform edit light etc all equal none predomin despit hollywood s dialogu myopia cinema is not about dialogu nor is it about beauti light action or music it work best when all the element are on an equal foot where onli the blend of those element in the order or combin in which they are present will communic the idea reduc or elimin the contribut of one element and the film ha no mean europa is what cinema should strive to be 
 
 
 
despit read the initi comment from someon who curious dislik the film whi is the onli negat comment veri first on the list it wa veri nice to note that virtual everyon el love it obvious the church want to stress certain point and portray the prophet joseph smith in a posit manner that the whole idea and in fact those point were extrem effect we alreadi know joseph smith wa human but despit that and all of the horrif negat attempt stir on by the adversari it show just how he wa abl to complet a remark god given work i d recommend it to anyon 
 
 
 
this is one of the most spiritu movi i have ever seen i head up with about peopl to st georg and we saw this movi in the visit center of the st georg templ not one person had dri eye in the audienc also there were some non religi and anti mormon peopl in the audienc who felt the spirit of the movi and were touch by the captiv music and reenact of the stori of the pioneer and the hardship they face becaus of their belief i recommend this movi for anyon who wish to understand more about joseph and the hardship that the pioneer went through after all it is apart of american histori 
 
 
 
i realli thought they did an excel job there wa noth wrong with it at all i don t know how the first comment could have said it wa terribl it move me to tear i guess it move about everyon to tear but i tri not to cri in a movi becaus it s embarrass but this one got me it wa sooo good i hope they releas it on dvd becaus i will definit buy a copi i feel like it renew my faith and gave me a hope that i can t explain it made me want to strive to be a better person they went through so much and we kind of take that for grant i guess compar to that i feel like our own trial are noth well not noth but they hard match what they had to go through i love it who play emma 
 
 
 
have no illus this is a moral stori granger is the troubl ex buffalo hunter tempt back to the plain one more time by kill craze taylor granger can see the end is near and feel deepli for the cost of the hunt on the herd the indian and the land itself taylor on the other hand admit equat kill buffalo or indian to be with a woman while granger s role of the tortur hunter is superb it s taylor who steal the show a the dement immor everyman out for the fast buck and the goodtim there s not a lot of bang bang here but the stori move along quick and we are treat to a fine charact perform by nolan the theme of this stori is just a poignant today a in the s man s relationship to the land and what s on it and racism consid when this wa made the censor must have been wring their hanki dure the scene in the bawdi hous taylor s relationship with the squaw and much of the dialogu although downbeat this is truli a great western pictur 
 
 
 
warn mild spoiler the stori of joseph smith stand out a an amaz even move episod in american histori and world religi histori this movi portray event in the life of joseph smith whom mormon rever a the prophet of the restor of the true church of jesus christ on the earth i ve so far seen the movi twice in it first month of public show joseph smith is shown first to be the youngest of a trio of brother alvin hyrum joseph who at a veri young age need an oper the oper done without our modern conveni wa bloodi and difficult the scene help to show the cohes of the smith famili and the bond between the brother and between joseph and his parent joseph s religi confus and subsequ pray which lead to what mormon call the first vision wa interest portray the face of jesus is never shown but you see the unmistak nail mark in his hand the reject by religi leader and mani in his small new york communiti is sweeten at least slight by joseph s marriag to emma this movi doe not clear map out the event of mormon church histori but mere jump from scene to scene this is not a critiqu simpli a note about the style the practic of tar and feather is shown and it is especi dramat and move when joseph deliv a sermon about the savior s love with a scar face from have recent been attack the movi master portray simultan the joy and growth of mormon a an infant church while at the same time the ever deepen opposit that spread into the height of local govern the film show mani scene from joseph s life includ a few beauti moment portray his relationship to emma an attempt is made to show the depth and complex of joseph s life includ his fierc love for his wife his endless love for child his wit his courag in the face of filthi and danger opposit his religi sentiment and his compass a joseph and hyrum ride to carthag never to return home aliv most of the charact from throughout the movi whose live had been touch by joseph are shown along the way help to reinforc what wa alreadi seen but set up the final scene to be more power at the end the martyrdom of joseph and hyrum is portray and moviego are left to ponder the event they just wit when i first watch the movi i assum it wa made by the church to introduc joseph smith to non member i no longer think that is the case although i hope the movi can do just that a an insid i find that the film is a celebr of joseph and excel reinforc the good thing we alreadi know about him i am curious to see how outsid will view the film whether they will simpli see it a propagand an epic stori of an american religi man or someth el the film is beauti shot famili friend move and hope someth good for everyon that the event portray actual happen in these unit state of america is interest to ponder in light of the mani aspect of our cultur includ freedom of religi express and respect general for the law we modern take for grant

thought at first this film would be your typic western film howev it turn out to be veri interest and kept me spellbound right to the veri end which turn out veri unusu charlton heston sam burgad midway had past experi with jame coburn zach provo deadfal and zach never forgav sam and would stop at noth to make sure he caught up with him and paid him back unfortun barbara hershey susan burgad the portrait of a ladi manag to get caught up in this situat and found herself among sex starv men who never seem to leav her alon sam burgad had to make some veri hard decis and and i wa quit surpris at the conclus this is a veri entertain film and the act wa outstand 
 
 
 
 the last hard men is a typic western for the s most of them seem to be inspir by sam peckinpah also this one but director andrew mclaglan is a john ford pupil and this can be obvious shown in mani scene imo the begin is veri good in a certain way mclaglan want to show the audienc a travel from the civil to the wilder in the third part there are some illog flaw and i complain a bit about charlton heston he ha to play an old ex lawman name sam burgad but he is in a fantast physic shape i never got the feel that he realli ha problem to climb on a hors or on a rock for me he didn t look veri motiv a he usual do in most of his epic movi same goe to the beauti barbara hershey who is play the sheriff s daughter mayb both had troubl with the director or were unhappi with their role hershey and coburn are not show their best but they are still good if the scriptwrit had john wayn in their mind a sam burgad also michael park a modern sheriff is a bit underus in his role on the other hand there is jame coburn a outlaw zach provo coburn is a realli great villain in this one he is portray the bad guy between maniac hate and clever his role and his act is the best of the movi landscap and shootout are terrif the shoot scene are bloodi and the violenc look realist zach provo and his gang had some gori and violent scene what i miss is the typic western action in the middl of the movi i would have appreci a bank robberi or someth similar overal it s an entertain western flick not a great movi but abov the averag becaus of a great coburn a veri good begin and some gori and violent scene

a shift in outlook is neccesari to enjoy modern british film one that somehow allow them to be seen in their own right and for their own qualiti rather than by the criterion that american film are judg britfilm ha to tri hard to be gritti and find it hard to make it but at warmth british film can lord it over their otherwis overwhelm competitor this film fail not in it content but onli in attach itself to the predeccesor so allow it to be all to easili seen a the work of star and director somewher near the end of their tether it s a coupl of decad later gregori teach and this time with two girl on his mind he teach at his school rail against human right abus when student he s fire up find abus in their midst he must face whether he s just all talk this is a subvers film in that there s not the usual world charact of ani american movi that you expect to do whatev he doe but a naiv man boy who may still put everyth on the line for principl mayb it s certain no protest by number though be too warm where u s film may seem realist becaus they re urban and gritti this and other british film of recent year those that don t tri to match america for viscer thrill are real becaus british humour reveal truth

the dvd for danaza macabra castl of blood is veri odd that s becaus part of the film are in french with subtitl and the rest is dub into english from the french sometim charact switch between the two in the middl of a scene when i tri to get the film to be just subtitl or just dub it made no differ odd but still watchabl the stori purport to be base on a poe stori though i can t recal which one in fact the charact of poe appear in the begin and end of the film though it didn t look especi like him a rich man make a bet with a guy down on his luck that he cannot stay the entir night in a manner home it seem like an easi bet to win even if the hous is veri creepi howev it can t be that easi a the rich guy say that all those who previous took the bet die yet this fool still want to make the wager while in the home he meet love barbara steel within and fall mad for her later howev he learn that she die more than a decad earlier how can this be i could tell you more about the plot but don t want to spoil ani of the suspens see it for yourself to find out the rest of the stori this film get veri high mark for creat a creepi atmospher the hous black white cinematographi and music work togeth to make for a scari look film a for the plot it s interest especi becaus there are mani twist and turn so mani that you are wonder just who is and who isn t among the undead by the end of the film the onli negat is that i felt sorri for the poor snake that wa needle kill crazi a it might sound i felt sorri for it and it hard seem necessari also parent may want to know that toward the end there is a bit of nuditi a strike beauti woman appear topless but it s hard necessari for the plot 
 
 
 
i rememb see this film at the west end theater in louisvill kentucki when i wa a boy the scene where dr carmus find the garden s coffin and the breath dead bodi therein wa the scariest part of the movi for me onli intensifi by the dark of the film i also wonder about the peopl hang from the tree at the end until i recogn the part of the film in which the famili name of the blackwood wa chang from blackblood due to the fact that in the famili histori there wa a charact who wa known for his mani hang of various peopl sir thoma blackwood seem to get his kick out of ad to the death caus by his famili i also notic that a foster first enter the gate of the cemeteri he is care in notic the sharp object of the gate where he meet his end i would not hesit to recommend this film to horror movi lover 
 
 
 
this begin a wager between edgar allen poe and a journalist poe bet that the man can not spend an entir night in a creepi castl well of cours he can but will he come out unscath hard to say with all these strang peopl that aren t suppos to be there wander around includ the ici barbara steel this is a fair odd film in that the present is both in french and english and switch back and forth a few time perhap this is done becaus bit of dialog were lost it s also rather dark and claustrophob be that one doesn t see much beyond a small circl of light that candl and such generat plus there s a feel of dread and impend doom pretti much at all time this version on synaps is also uncensor and i wonder what might be censor in a film from until i saw the topless scene i guess that might be it overal this is pretti good and in gloomi black and white barbara steel definit make the movi too out of

for those of you who think anim is just about giant reptil rape schoolgirl think again there is a total differ side to the japanes anim yakit japan is one of those show it is a sweet natur tale of a young boy with the gift to make delici bread his univers is all about creat a japanes bread that can match with the famous european bread the show is a wacki a they come and i m sure that non japanes viewer will miss a lot of the joke but it is still veri nice to watch becaus of the complet innoc vibe of the show in the world of yakit it is not uncommon for peopl to look like they ve just had an orgasm after eat bread the bread is hallucin and can give the consum a wide array of super power from time travel to swim like a fish that weird aspect make it into one of the least predict and funni show i ve watch in a while 
 
 
 
when i first start watch this anim i never thought that someth about make bread could actual be interest but thank i wa mistaken from the moment i start watch it anim just pull into the world of bread make i wa hook the biggest advantag of this anim is it s humor which is veri intellig and veri funni with some recur gag but the anim soundtrack and charact develop are below averag while these disadvantag aren t seen so much in the first episod becaus of the great job on this anim it realli start to show in the last episod when the reaction and recur gag just grow old and aren t a funni a befor a far a i m concern if this anim had end with episod i would have given it a but the last episod just leav a bitter aftertast which sad can t be wash away by the awesom episod

anoth comment about this film made it sound lousi given talk pictur were so new i think the script and act were good davi wa so young and fresh she had not yet found her own style that we had grown to expect yet it is great to see her this way still learn the craft so mani clich s came from this film and it seem this film blaze some trail for the next year my vote is see it and rememb how young this type of film wa keep and open mind and you mayb shock at how troubl the charact were in this pictur for be and how we view the earli part of last centuri a uptight i love it and hope you make up your own mind about it not influenc by other negat and one note comment 
 
 
 
somerset maugham s charact are brought to life in rko s of human bondag but the movi is a too skelet version of the novel with bett davi star make perform suck up all of the energi otherwis it s the stori of lesli howard a philip carey he dream of becom a painter but is told he ha no talent for the art a the film progress mr howard s struggl instead to becom a doctor his effort seem to indic some bad advic regard the art though success in medicin his paint seem easier also note the symbol of his disabl a club foot explain in the film along the way right away in this version howard becom infatu with waitress davi a mildr roger davi character of mildr is extraordinari culmin in a spectacular speech when she tell howard among other thing that she had to wipe my mouth after kiss him howard also perform well but the stori fail to explain his prolong fascin and love for davi so their perform are wast still a film to watch for the act includ some good support player bett davi character wa famous for inspir a write in campaign for the best actress academi award for the record she place third the result were claudett colbert it happen one night norma shearer the barrett of wimpol street bett davi of human bondag grace moor one night of love of human bondag john cromwel lesli howard bett davi reginald denny
 
 
 
the movi may be great i just watch it last night but feel unabl to give an honest opinion of it becaus i read the book first the book is so much better than the movi that i wa disappoint with the film if you plan to watch of human bondag don t read the book beforehand on the other hand the book is so good and contain so much more than the love affair phillip ha with mildr you could still enjoy it after see the movi i do not make this claim light i averag read a book everi day and read such dispar author a daniell steel ovid faulkner plato and shakespear of human bondag get my vote a one of the top ten novel ever written 
 
 
 
this adapt of somerset maugham s novel put bett davi on the map a a movi actress she might have won an academi award for her perform but the film wa made on loan so her studio didn t push for her her act in this one doesn t come off well by today s standard a the heartless waitress who jerk philip a sensit medic student around and near ruin his life davi is way too shrill almost demon director john cromwel who usual elicit good perform from his actress wa perhap overwhelm by this one davi is watchabl for sure but so strident and predatori a to seem scarc human i imagin the charact of milli a quieter le feminin than davi with mayb a touch of the tomboy davi is such a strong immedi presenc that s there s no air of mysteri to her which make philip s attract to her seem more overt masochist than it should be a philip lesli howard is excel his wan somewhat wilt good look are perfect for this fail aesthet nor doe he impos a person interpret on the part a say dirk bogard might have done which give his work a rare clariti he seem complet in control here a he should be play a man with a ration intellect who is in the grip of irrat emot he cannot manag or even fulli satisfi a the object of his affect move him in way he cannot understand howard wa a fine actor too often cast in standard romant part which compel him to fall back on charm which he doesn t use here it s been so long sinc i ve read the book i don t feel comfort comment on the movi s faith to it i think it captur the spirit of the stori well enough and that it ha in howard a perfect philip carey the sexual undercurr are mute and at time philip behav so masochist that in the absenc of strong sex feel make one wonder about the charact s saniti sure not mr maugham s intent thank to howard s perform philip remain firm in focus a one can see in his various respons to and yearn for milli the extrem to which a reason intellect will go to understand the irrat in himself and in other overal a veri good film a littl stilt at time due to it age it evok london nice and is well act for the most part 
 
 
 
i just saw of human bondag for the first time a few day ago and wow what a mysteri and almost spooki film i love how the music went with the pace of each step of philip s foot it gave me the chill for some reason one of the greatest aspect of this film is that you get to see bett davi come into herself right befor your eye she s great not necessarili becaus this is her best work but becaus it wa so out of the ordinari to be so vicious gritti and unflinch a an actress in bett wa a risk taker alway want to be differ and this is right about when she start to realiz that she could be a nasti and dare a she want and peopl would love her for it if you re a true lover of film it s amaz to see she just had a way of deliv a line that made the part and the film for that matter belong to her like a mass of music and fire that s me an old kazoo and some sparkler or but you are blanch you are in that chair or with all my heart i still love the man i kill those are from a few of her film but you get my drift she wa just so brave sassi and exot look with those beauti big eye after see this i can t believ it wa remad twice lesli howard wa gorgeous so calm and persist need to be love i thought he wa ador and couldn t understand how everyon wasn t fall for him but then again everyon wa except mildr he did a great job the onli thing that i didn t like wa someth that wa common with the write in the earli film they d make a charact so hate that it s almost unbeliev that someon would actual fall for them in the first place the perform were great but in real life philip would have never been interest in mildr that s just the simpl truth see it 
 
 
 
this is a well direct film from john cromwel who wa not a great director but who did make some fine film includ the version of the prsoner of zenda set in a london that onli hollywood could manag atmospher but noth like the real thing it is a stori of ob and thwart love from the novel by somerset maughan i wa look forward to see it on dvd a i had never seen it befor and be a great admir of bett davi want to see her in a role consid one of her earli great one so i bought it well she look fine but i m sorri to say her london cockney accent just made me laugh bett davi wa one of the greatest film actor make no mistak but here she did make one it wa imposs to take her charact serious it wasn t a gruesom a the dick van dyke mari poppin cockney accent but close in the other major role wa lesli howard and he did it superbl he wa a subtl and intellig actor the support actor acquit themselv well worth watch despit m davi vocal gymnast 
 
 
 
bett davi cockney accent in this film is absolut appal i total understand that american and other nation mightn t realis this and that s fine but believ me it s about half a good a dick van dyke s cockney accent in mari poppin and that wa a right load of old poni slip into london vernacular there mani apolog the remark thing to me is that the strang accent and exagger act style don t detract from the film power of human bondag is a fascin piec of cinema despit it superfici fault it also ha to be view in perspect the technic and cultur limit of film make at the time have to be appreci and given those limit john cromwel doe a veri good job direct the camera and allow the narrat to develop cinemat rather than sole via the manner act and stilt dialogu a fine exampl of his skill direct is the scene set at victoria station it is beauti conceiv shot and edit note too the stark shot of the prostrat mildr toward the end of the film they owe more to the earli day of artist film make than the sanitis formula world of the studio that wa about to domin the theme of the film are univers familiar and compel one sexual ob unrequit love scorn passion self loath manipul relationship social divid and youth folli though the dialogu is often rather hackney the difficult task of portray these theme and the inner live of the charact is tackl well albeit in a low key way some of the scene of ob and emot reject are uncomfort to watch but the stori doesn t descend into clich we re awar that the charact even the poison mildr are both victim and perpetr and that their action are motiv by their misunderstand of each other feel a well a by wil selfish whilst naiv in style the stori reach to the complex heart of the human condit and the manner natur of the act and the occasion grate exchang don t diminish the verac of the work of human bondag wa one of the film that got bett davi notic in hollywood and whilst watch it you are conscious of be wit at the birth of a celebr career her unconvent beauti and screen charisma no one flounc or did disdain quit like m davi grab your attent from her first appear whilst her is definit the memor perform in the film lesli howard is also excel a the sensit and fragil student philip carey they are a good combin though whi oh whi didn t he help her with that terribl terribl accent 
 
 
 
enjoy in spite of lesli howard s perform mr howard play philip a a flat uninterest charact one is suppos to feel sorri for this man howev i find myself cheer bett davi mildr m davi give one her finest perform she receiv an academi award nomin thank to her perform she bring this rather dull movi to life be sure not to miss when mildr tell philip exact how she feel about him

i thought this would be a sequel to the origin th chamber of shaolin but actual it s more of a light heart sister to the origin gordon liu still star a a would be hero on a quest to learn kung fu to defeat those peski manchu but this time around it s lighter and more comed the film centr around the local dye mill where wage are cut due to the hire of new manchurian bos liu play chao who is abl to fool the mill bos into think he is a shaolin monk posse almost magic kung fu skill but his luck run out he is expo a a fraud and he promis the mill worker that he will go to the shaolin monasteri to learn kung fu and return to protect them the comedi realli begin at the monasteri where chao make sever bungl attempt to get accept this set up lot of realli funni moment and lot of great fight choreographi continu in the th chamber tradit we see all kind of neat and interest and suprem hokey train method at the monasteri a well a creativ use of wooden bench a weapon also uniqu and of note is the blend of kung fu and the craft of bamboo scaffold build chao is not accept a a student at shaolin but is made to build bamboo scaffold for the year restor of the monasteri on the dvd i bought there is a special on bamboo scaffold build and the inspir that director lau kar leung drew from it this is a craft mani hundr perhap thousand of year old and in hong kong scaffold is still built of bamboo even on larg high rise though the west exclus use steel tube and clamp a a result of his scaffold work chao develop a special style of kung fu when ask what kind it is he hilari repli scaffold kung fu which he first test dure a dust up with the monasteri s abbot in the final confront with the manchu there is a dazzl array of creativ use for bamboo pole and tie from a comedi perspect i think it s one of the best of the kung fu genr a a kung fu film in general it also stand out i recommend it to anyon 
 
 
 
i saw this movi onc on late night t v and knew it wa the best movi ever this is one of the few kung fu movi with a decent plot the progress of the main charact is seamless the whole movi is great 
 
 
 
return to the th chamber is the comed sequel to the epic th chamber of shaolin in which gordon liu play shan te a young man who becam a monk and awesom fighter in this sequel liu play a hapless loser who ha to learn kung fu after caus his friend to be beaten he imit the origin shan te tri all manner of trick to get into shaolin templ to learn and eventu get some uniqu skill to fight some bulli bos it a classic light heart martial art tale with the ace product valu of the shaw brother and the sure foot direct of lui chia liang the choreographi is fantast throughout whether for fight or slapstick comedi and gordon liu s perform a are the other particular the sympathet monk work perfect for the materi the film is le epic or profound than some of the star other work and there are certain grander more violent and sweep shaw brother film but few have such a magic blend of slapstick uniqu train and fight with a subtl yet warm tale of a useless guy make good full of light heart joy it imposs not to give this the highest score 
 
 
 
this movi ha a lot of comedi not dark and gordon liu shine in this one he display his comic side and it wa realli weird see him get beat up his train is unorthodox and who would ve thought knot tie could be so dead lot of great stunt and choreographi veri creativ add johnni wang in the mix and you ve got an awesom final showdown don t mess with manchu thug they re ruthless

romant comedi can realli go either way you know you ll see one that s realli sappi and you ll think you want someth more realist then you ll see one that s realist but it might be too dull to keep you interest or mayb you ll see one that doe everyth right but just fail to make you smile romant comedi are tough movi you go into them with a lot of expect and usual whether you like it is simpli a matter of whether the filmmak wa anticip your expect or those of the guy or girl next to you of cours if you ve got a girl next to you and you re a guy like me it probabl doesn t matter all that much whether the movi s ani good you ve got other thing on your mind for you i say go get her tiger for the rest of u i say see _a guy thing_ it s a lot of fun becaus _a guy thing_ know you re go in to this movi with expect so it doesn t pretend that it guy about to get marri meet the woman of his dream and it s not his wife plot is go to make everyon happi sure mayb you like it but mayb it doesn t ring true or you think it s cruel _a guy thing_ cover that what _a guy thing_ doe is fill the screen with the best support cast i ve seen in a long time so if you don t the main plotlin you ve still got someth to make you smile whether we re talk about the season veteran of big and small screen like larri miller pretti woman best in show jame brolin traffic juli hagerti airplan david koechner saturday night live and conan o brien regular dirti work austin power ii or thoma lennon the state and viva varieti or new face like shawn hatosi the faculti or colin foo save silverman we re talk about a bunch of veri talent and skill actor who know exact how to take advantag of the film s inspir characteris steal the show time after time and still frame the piec with an energi and a joy rare seen in romant comedi these day and that s not to detract from the actual romant throughlin and the star that carri it along becaus it s veri sweet and terribl well done jason lee mallrat chase ami dogma etc is touch a the young profession whose life may be spin out of control and selma blair show an underst brillianc in portray the aspir socialit and sophist career woman everi guy want to marri except for the guy who actual is a lot of the success of the movi though fall on julia stile the right girl in the right place at the wrong time and she wear it well not sinc gosh i don t know when have i seen an actress in a romant comedi that ha made fall in love with her so easi of cours it s all in the closeup the voic and the subtl smile but it s magic and it s one of the big reason whi we go to the movi in the first place but juli stile s slight offbeat sophist would be lost were it not for the fact that the rest of the cast is so incred dead on in their classic simplic this is a movi that paint a broken world of irreconcil stock type make them fall over each other to make you laugh and then come through with a great deal of heart a guy thing is a movi you ve definit seen befor and the filmmak clear knew that when they set down to make it we haven t realli seen ani new romant comedi sinc shakespear the relat success of this one or that one is entir depend upon the execut of the classic stori of boy meet girl a guy thing doe embrac that with a bit of a metacinemat edg often take the scene into the absurd in order to give the audienc a chanc to acknowledg the power emot and ancient plot devic at play for the record it also even manag to poke fun at the rather tradit structur notion of sex and gender that form the center of everi romant comedi so even the feminist out there might get a kick out of it and guy i think we can all agre that we wish our friend are a cool a jason lee s friend in this movi i m not go to spoil it for you but when you tri to explain to your girlfriend whi the pharmacist and the cloth store clerk are among the coolest dude in cinema i suggest you just say it s a guy thing and leav it at that 
 
 
 
i think the deal with this movi is that it ha about minut of realli realli funni moment and it make a veri good trailer and a lot of peopl came in with expect from the trailer and this time the movi doesn t live up to the trailer it s a littl more sluggish and drag a littl slowli for such an excit premis and i think i m see from the comment peopl have a love hate relationship with this movi howev if you look at this movi for what it is and not what it could have been consid the talent of the cast i think it s still pretti good julia stile is clear the star she s so giddi and carefre that set among the conform of everyon el she just glow and the whole audienc fall in love with her along with lee the rest of the cast of cours lee s testosteron fill cowork his eleg mother in law his fratlik friend jim and his bride to be all do an excel job of fit into stereotyp of conform and boring that make stile stand out in the first place lee doesn t live up to his costar i don t think but you could view that a more that they re hard to live up to mayb that s one sourc of disappoint the movi itself despit a bit of slow and a few joke that don t come off a funni a the writer s intend is still pretti funni and i found a rather intellig film the theme of conform and take the safe rout seem to clever align on sever layer for exampl there wa the whole motif of how he would imagin scenario but would never act on them until the last scene or how he wa listen to a radio program on the highway talk about how everyon conform or just how everyth selma blair and julia stile charact said and did wa echo by those theme of one person be the safe choic and one be the riski choic the other good thing about the movi wa that it wa kind of a screwbal comedi in which jason lee ha to keep lie his way through the movi and who through dumb luck exampl the pharmaci guy turn out to be a good chef and some clever on his part get away with it for the most part while it wasn t a funni a i expect and there wa a littl bit of squander talent but overal it s still a good movi

the ladi from shanghai is proof that the great genius orson well could direct a mainstream movi if he want to by comparison to his other more artist work this film ha onli a moder amount of crafti and almost no esoter element the except be of cours the final scene in the hall of mirror wide agre to be one of the greatest scene in the histori of film it alon is worth the cost of a rental the sweet surpris wa the superb act by the beauti rita hayworth her act dure the begin and middl of the film is so excel she made the other actor appear a caricatur instead of charact even the great mr well

despit love rita hayworth find the final few sequenc of the film intrigu and be abl to appreci some of the subtler symbol aspect of the cinematographi the ladi from shanghai didn t quit work for me i had a problem with most of the perform the script and the overal structur and in a film that s most peopl talk with each other in various situat that s quit a problem the ladi from shanghai end up at a veri low c or a for me the ladi from shanghai is realli all about orson well charact michael o hara o hara see elsa rosali bannist rita hayworth in central park on a carriag ride and hit on her later he save her from a mug and she take a shine to him o hara is a seaman from ireland and the globetrot elsa happen to own a yacht with her husband arthur everett sloan a veri famous and power california defens attorney they talk o hara into work for them despit his initi reserv it seem to him and to the audienc that elsa is just look for someon to have an affair with and o hara doesn t want to get involv short after go to work on their yacht a strang man georg grisbi glenn ander who say he s arthur s partner show up at a port of call and begin stir up troubl eventu grisbi ask o hara to enter into a veri dubious and danger scheme foolish o hara agre natur it get him into quit a bit of troubl and eventu a number of mysteri are reveal mayb my problem with the film lie in the fact that so far i m not exact a huge fan of orson well and here he produc write direct and consum most of the screen time i haven t seen anywher near the major of well work yet but i ve tend to like his later film better when he becam a bit more campi and perform arti i love f for fake v rit s et mensong for exampl and i even kind of like his perform in casino royal when he bizarr insist on be allow to do magic trick at a baccarat tabl but citizen kane never did much for me despit give it or chanc over the year includ about one year ago my rate wa a low the same a my current score for the ladi from shanghai well perform and the dialogu he s written for himself come across a affect and pretenti to me he s a bit of a motormouth a bit of a boor and a bit monoton he tend to sound like he s read his perform remind me of what i ve seen of well version of mobi dick list on imdb a but complet in it can also be seen in orson well the one man band where he seem to be just read to the camera and believ that he s inher sublim dramat i m also someon who almost never complain about accent but somehow well manag to make his irish accent sound affect and pretenti to me too a for the other perform i can onli say i thought hayworth did an excel job of cours she s gorgeous which doesn t hurt plenti of eye candi here like well sloan also seem a bit affect and pretenti to me i never quit bought his charact his handicap and so on and ander is simpli bizarr where bizarr doesn t seem to fit well often shoot him in close up and ander almost alway ha some over exagger manic express on his sweati face structur the ladi from shanghai is veri uneven the first minut or so are extrem bland and soap operat although the soap opera ministr tend to be approach from a tortuous obliqu onc grisbi introduc his scheme thing pick up a bit and most improv a we near the end but by the time the ladi from shanghai becom a crime mysteri film it s too littl too late and it quick turn into a courtroom drama befor the sudden thrill end that come almost out of nowher and is over far too quick for it relat excel the end is more action orient le dialogu heavi more vari and exot in set and at time fair abstract well handl that combin of materi skill a a director if the ladi from shanghai would have been a larg a combin of the crime mysteri stuff and the arti end it could have easili been at least a the final scene are easili s a well shift from a hitchcockian suspens scene in a san francisco chine opera hous to anoth suspens scene in a chine amus park the funhous climax use cinematographi that wa experiment for it time it s well integr with the script a it allow a complex resolut and fuel a lot of symbol the cinematographi throughout is interest even if it usual can t make up for the problem in the foreground well block scene with skill there are lot of attract film set from central park to acapulco to various san francisco locat well effect creat symbol backdrop for his action from the emphas height and precipit drop of acapulco to the maze like caribbean street the beauti frame and silhouet shot of the san francisco aquarium and so on the romanc materi for which the aquarium serv a one backdrop is interest temper with a kind of uneas throughout the film but on the other hand that make the romanc never quit work a romanc sure serious well fan will appreci the ladi from shanghai much more than i did and of cours it s worth a watch if you love rita hayworth the ladi from shanghai isn t exact a terribl film in my view but it s danger close to not pas proceed with caution

a winter approach our state own broadcast the abc ha decid for some reason to have a partial jane austen festiv on sunday night this commenc with a twelv year old movi length version of emma last sunday more recent version of three other novel persuas northang abbey and mansfield park are to come the curious thing about this product by a e televis network with script by the ever reliabl andrew davi is that it appear almost simultan with two much bigger budget movi version one star gwyneth paltrow and clueless a modern version star alicia silverston which transport the plot to bever hill perhap a a result even with kate beckinsal in the lead this product sank without trace a a general rule much is lost when novel are shrunk to fit featur movi length the adapt one tend to both enjoy and rememb are those which have adequ room to develop both stori and charact an outstand exampl is brideshead revisit which had minut episod back in you onli have to compar the veri ordinari movi length version of pride and prejudic in with the brilliant six part tv mini seri it s not that a novel should be film page by page and some novel often not veri good one adapt wonder to film aton is a recent exampl but novel of the jane austen sort need some time and space to exert their full charm given the shortcom of this type of adapt this product is ok kate beckinsal give emma the right mix of self assured and vulner and mark strong is a forthright mr knight he remind me that jane tend to recycl charact knight is a more articul version of the moodi mr darci of p p samantha morton wa a rather limp harriet but prunella scale got the blabbermouth miss bate perfect sybil fawlti on speed bernard hepton a emma s feebl father wa also excel we saw the damp countrysid the mud and the poverti a well a the posh interior in case anyon thought this wa a particular idyl age for everybodi even though this wa a condens adapt it wa odd slow in place some of the convers were rather stilt even allow for the formal of the time i d have to look at the film again to be sure but it might be due to the under use of reaction shot if you do like film period stuff this is a perfect nice exampl and compar well with the paltrow version anyway there is more to come 
 
 
 
the minut i start watch this i realis that i wa watch a qualiti product so i wa not surpris to find that the screenplay wa written by andrew davi and wa produc by sue birtwhistl both of these brought u the excel product of pride and prejudic so my onli gripe here is that emma did not run to or or mayb even six episod like pride and prejudic the act wa superb with i think prunella scale excel a miss bate but i love kate beckinsal and mark strong just a much the languag is a delight to listen to can you imagin in this day and age have a right go at someon without actual utter a swear word samantha morton wa excel a miss smith in fact the cast wa spot on much a it wa with pride and prejudic i like it so much that i watch it twice in two day so onc again thank you bbc for anoth qualiti piec of televis i have seen the paltrow version and it is okay but i do think the bbc version is far superior an excel product that i am veri happi to own on dvd 
 
 
 
i realli love this version of emma the best kate beckinsal wa awesom a emma and mark strong wa veri good a knight the onli complaint that i had wa on mr woodhous i can t believ that a man could whine so much or be so selfish with his daughter s life she wa a smart girl in the end though a alway i love the place in which these jane austin movi were shot the set are so spectular it make me want to visit england so much a well a ireland and scotland i think the actor chosen for this movi were a good choic a well and all the other stori line interwhin with emma s most excel i am glad that i got to see this one a well 
 
 
 
until the s there had never been a film base upon jane austen s emma then two came along in the same year or if you count s clueless which updat austen s plot to a modern american high school three in two year the main charact is emma woodhous a young ladi from a well to do famili in regenc england she is financi consider better off than most austen heroin such a elizabeth bennett or fanni price and ha no need to find herself a wealthi husband instead her main preoccup seem to be find husband for her friend she persuad her friend harriet to turn down a propos of marriag from a young farmer robert martin believ that harriet should be set her sight on the ambiti clergyman mr elton this scheme goe disastr wrong howev a elton ha no interest in harriet but ha fallen in love with emma herself the speed with which emma reject his propos make one wonder just whi she wa so keen to match her friend with a man she regard with good reason a an unsuit marriag partner for herself this be a jane austen plot emma turn out to be le of a commit spinster than she seem and she too find herself fall in love lead to further complic today in kate beckinsal is a hollywood star but in despit be onli a year younger wa not near a well known intern a gwyneth paltrow she is howev just a convinc a austen s well intent but often wrong head heroin beckinsal seem to have a gift for classic role she made a delight hero in kenneth branagh s version of much ado about noth and i sometim find myself wish that hollywood could have found more suitabl role for her rather than wast her in turkey like pearl harbor or underworld i prefer jeremi northam to mark strong a emma s love interest mr knightley larg becaus he came closer to my own concept of the charact a a gentleman chivalr older man in some way more of a father figur to emma than a lover his surnam is probabl meant to indic his gentleman natur nineteenth centuri gentleman like to think of themselv a the modern equival of mediaev knight with their elabor code of chivalri strong tend to downplay the question of the age differ he is she and make knightley more of a passion lover and le of a wise mentor than doe northam samantha morton anoth actress who would go on to bigger thing is perhap closer to the harriet of the novel than wa toni collett this wa the more small scale of the two version be made for televis rather than the cinema and the set and costum seem le lavish and there are fewer big name among the cast costum drama howev is general someth that british televis doe well and this version can certain hold it own with the cinema version both are entertain and well made version of austen s novel 
 
 
 
it ha taken me a while to watch this version a unfortun i don t seem to be abl to rent it in the video store onli the other version but i fell in love with it i wa alway borderlin with the other emma gwenneth and toni collett a they are not british natur have to put on the accent and well to me it doesn t seem natur it seem put on sorri but don t think toni and gwenneth did a brilliant job there i could not warm to ani of the charact but this version is more heart warm and more the type of person i imagin emma to be it is definit the version i will come back to from now on i wa disappoint that mr knightley wa not better look but he is convinc i also like jane fairfax better play by olivia william i never warm to her in the movi version but she is better portray in this version come to think of it besid mr knightley all charact are better play and a lot le over the top unfortun both came out around same time and the paltrow version got more public piti i also love the new scene at the end well done to kate beckingsal therefor if you are a jane austen fan don t forget to watch this one 
 
 
 
i ve realli enjoy this adapt of emma i have seen it mani time and am alway look forward to see it again though it onli last minut most of the novel plot and sub plot were develop in a satisfactori way all the charact are well portray most of the dialogu come direct from the novel with no silli joke ad a in emma thompson s sen and sensibl a a foreign i particular appreci the perfect diction of the actor the set and costum were beauti i find this version quit on a par with the miniseri pride and prejudic but then the produc and screenwrit were the same kate beckinsal did a realli good job portray emma of whom jane austen said she would creat a heroin no one but her would love she is snobbish but ha just enough youth and inexperi to be still likabl mark strong wa also veri good at portray mr knightley not an easi part i think though he ha not the charisma shown by colin firth s mr darci in pride and prejudic even the end scene the harvest festiv which doe not happen in the novel provid a fit end except for when it show emma be cold and almost unpleas with frank churchil wherea in the novel she wa thorough reconcil with him even tell him that she would have enjoy the duplic had she been in his situat a strang departur from the faith otherwis shown throughout the film i find the costum more beauti and elabor than in other adapt from jane austen s novel 
 
 
 
this ha long been one of my favourit adapt of an austen novel although it is definit not in the same categori a the spectacular pride and prejudic emma is a lush and relat faith tv version of austen s novel especi consid it short length the biggest chang between the novel and the movi is a good one a the unnecessari snobbish that austen exhibit at the end of the stori is remov here and replac with someon much more akin to emma s charact in the rest of the book i thought the charact chosen to portray the role were well pick kate beckinsal walk the fine line between girlish and the social snob with a grace complet lost in gwyneth paltrow s version samantha morton s wispi blond lock suit her attitud and charact a the simper that accompani her role in previous characteris is replac with the harriet we know from the book mister knight s role is carri out extrem well in my opinion both the serious and the gentl compass that the hero is paint with in the novel are present here in this much neglect sumptuous film 
 
 
 
i ve seen this movi after watch paltrow s version i ve found that one a veri good one and i thought this would not be a good but i wa wrong british version wa far better and enjoy i found jeremi northam more agreeabl than mark strong but i can say that strong catch much better austen s knightley anyway both version are good but anyon that love austen s book should watch this movi i agre with caall andrew davi chang a few thing but still remain faith to the origin out of my cent 
 
 
 
this is a better adapt of the book than the one with paltrow although i like that one too it isn t so much that beckinsal is better they are both veri good but that the screenplay is better davi is a master at adapt austen for film and the product valu here are veri good it s not quit a glossi a the hollywood treatment but it s close and i thought that the locat and the costum actual work better 
 
 
 
jane austen s emma is an extrem enjoy stori at the worst of time and this product of the stori is the best i have ever seen kake beckinsal s emma is irreproach gwyneth paltrow with the help of a good screenplay and excel cinematographi is abl to bring out the comedi effect she fail to make emma likeabl paltrow is not aid by the fact that her hairstyl are simpli wrong for the part and i believ the era and she look posit ill in the empir line dress kate beckinsal on the other hand manag the comedi effortless and is still abl to show what mr knight the most romant of jane austen s hero actual see in her mark strong is a splendid mr knight with the right mix of handsom look an appropri age chivalri compass and gentleman behaviour emma and mr knight are support by a cast of good actor and the product a a whole is quit delight 
 
 
 
this is a excel start to the film career of mickey rooney his talent here show that a long career is ahead for him the car and truck chase is excit for the era this start of the andi hardi seri is an american treasur in my book spring byington perform is excel a usual plea mr rooney or owner of the film right take a chanc and get this produc on dvd i think it would be a winner

i think it s one of the greatest movi which are ever made and i ve seen mani the book is better but it s still a veri good movi 
 
 
 
can such an ambient product have fail it primari goal which wa to correct adapt allend s novel obvious yes bill august manag to make a superfici shallow film where basic element of south american mental are present simpli a side event result in total incoher i can t believ there wa a whole product team that could not understand the book there is of cours technic qualiti in this film and i think the actor did their best with what they had in their hand but someth is miss and this someth wa the most import part 
 
 
 
perhap the best isabel allend s book hous of the spirit describ an altern chilean histori this one full of magic a mystic veil plus some kind of omnipres sad this movi gather a great cast plus a great art direct with a script that cannot contain all this book s qualiti it s unusu for a near unknown countri like chile to get so well repres a it is by this movi whose perhap onli sin is to aim too high and becaus of that left the illiter public a littl upset most becaus they understood veri littl 
 
 
 
well i said it all in the summari i simpley ador the movi and the cast i would give each actor an oscar great great movi i m now and i watch it time in differ period and i alway think i won t cri and i alway do about or time meryl s wa absolut brilliant jeremi iron also just brilliant i wish the movi receiv more award i realli don t know anybodi who watch it and didn t love it also glenn close wa fantast the stori wa beauti and sad at the same time i love the fact that despit everyth clara and esteban love each other so much and how blanca wa close to her parent 
 
 
 
at first i didn t didn t like it that much although i did they didn t includ the third trueba generat the love between blanca and pedro wan t well explain and some actor were too differ from what i had imagin later i realiz that had the movi been more loyal to the book it would have been like five hour long and would be kind of tedious now i like it veri much becaus my favourit charact are there a i portrait them clara realli look like an angel in live and her introduct to the stori at the beggin of the film wa fantast loyal and short glenn close is ferula i pictur her just like that onli not in mourn throughout the whole thing esteban is find enough i never realli like his charact and although i wa interest in him i hate him a lot more special when he hit clara a in the book the veri last part is the most excit one and it ha real histori too there the movi is realli good special consid that it wa a gringo film base upon a latin american book it amaz how mani famous star are there don t you think so 
 
 
 
brilliant adapt of the novel that made famous the relat of chilean presid salvador allend kill in the environ of a larg estat that aris from the ruin becom a forc to abus and exploit of outrag a luxuri estat for the benefit of the upstart esteban trueba and his undeserv famili the brilliant danish director bill august recreat in micro which at the time would be the process lead to the greatest infami of his stori to the harden chilean nation and whose main charact would augusto pinochet stephen similar with it are inevit recal a an exampl that imag of the senat with dark glass that make him the wink to the general to begin make the palac bill august attend an except cast in the jeremi protrud iron whose charact chang from arrog and extrem cruelti the hard lesson that life alway bring u to almost forc u to chang in esteban fulli appli the law of reson with great wisdom solomon describ in these word the thing that freckl are the same punish that will serv you unforgett glenn close play splint the taint sister of stephen whose sin driven by loneli spiritu and platon love wa the wife of his cruel snowi brother meryl streep also brilliant a woman whose name came to him like a glove clara with telekinet power cognit and mediumist this harden woman loyal to his blunt conserv husband is an indic of charact and self control that we wish for ourselv and for all human be everi charact is a portrait of virtuos a blanca worthi rebel leader pedro segundo unhappi or a portrait of humili like stephen jr the bastard child of senat who serv a an instrument for the return of the boomerang the film move the bowel we recreat some fact that should not ever be repeat but that absurd still happen colombia is a sad exampl and anoth remind that against all life is wonder becaus there are alway peopl like isabel allend and immort just bill august 
 
 
 
i like the movi first of all becaus it told an interest stori but the stori a told in the movi felt like it wa condens from a much longer stori sinc the book is over page that make sen it span a time period from the s to the s in a fiction south american countri also a lot to fit into the time avail i think it would have been much better a a six hour mini seri than it turn out a a minut movi even though it s rush the stori doesn t skip so much that it get confus what is told is told fair well one fault is that clara s supernatur power appear inconsist either they should have appear more even through the cours of the movi or they should have been left out two more fault which could be spoiler esteban s eventu return to good happen somewhat too sudden and ferula s cur seem to wear off even though the tone of the stori suggest that it should endur forev the act is excel glenn close a the torment spinster ferula is outstand jeremi iron a the brutal self made rich man is also excel meryl streep a the main charact clara is great although she s often even better than she wa in this movi there were mani well perform smaller role too the biggest fault is that the movi seem to lack a dialect coach each actor seem to speak in a differ sort of accent 
 
 
 
the hous of the spirit is a grip tale of famili intrigu south american polit and super natur power meryl streep glenn close and jeremi iron bring isabel allend s novel to life with all it passion and suspens this in my view is one of the best film of the s jeremi iron a esteban trueba age and mellow veri believ while meryl streep in the role of clara maintain her gentl love warmth throughout her relat short life winona ryder and antonio bandera make a handsom coupl struggl for famili accept in a racist cultur glenn close a esteban s sister give a veri move perform the countrysid of portug is a reason substitut for a non tropic latin american countri set of clara s home and esteban s ranch are effect and the period u car add nice to the post war atmospher 
 
 
 
hotel du nord is a grip drama of guilt in which marcel carn portray an entertain tale of ill fate love which also function a a revolt against the cruel world the film is base entir on a pair of hapless lover pierr and rene were mistaken when they believ that suicid would put an end to their miseri hotel du nord ha it own inimit charm a it inhabit have becom an essenti part of the establish there is an element of togeth a everyon flock to hotel du nord to eat chat etc marcel carn ha remain true to the spirit of the film produc in s and s a hotel du nord ha a certain kind of nostalg feel carn while recreat the life of parisian road wa abl to creat a sort of nostalgia for black and white give a uniqu genr of poetic realism to his oeuvr hotel du nord can be term a a quintess of cinematograph popul the th juli ball scene on the bank of saint martin canal remain a magnific sequenc the film s immens popular can be judg from the fact that hotel du nord ha been declar a a nation monument 
 
 
 
a true classic beauti film and act reveal an area of pari which is aliv and fill with comedi and tragedi although the area of hotel du nord and the hotel itself still exist it is not a gay in the origin sen of the word and joy a it onc must have been the film make one yearn for the past which ha been lost with a sigh and bittersweet 
 
 
 
i love this movi jouvet arletti blier carn almost everyth ha alreadi been said about the movi but there is one detail i d like to shed some light onto no footag of the real still stand h tel du nord is it still i heard it wa to be demolish ha been use for the movi the whole scene ha been rebuilt on set the main reason be that they could not stop the traffic on the st martin canal for sever week 
 
 
 
this is an excel film and is the sort of treasur that one can onli catch through sporad cinema show a it is unavail on video dvd the way that the film begin with the two lover arriv and end with them leav although quit a lot happen in between and they don t stay in one place dure this time give you a sen of closur and a feel that all is right with the world if you get a chanc to see this film then do i can t wait to see it again and wish that it could be put on general releas 
 
 
 
i suppos i alway felt that hotel du nord wa studio bound the movement of peopl car and camera were just too effortless smooth and stagey to have been film on locat but no problem it s still a much underr love composit from marcel carn the plot seem a bit choppi at time a if they were make it up a they went along but becaus it is unpredict hold the attent to the bitter end the money shot when the lover are alon in their room are saddl with some rather stilt dialogu but it s all so love to fall into ani inan can be accept are these young peopl symbol of a cancer hopeless in pre war franc or simpli idiot suicid pact are fair common if the suicide are young and healthi with their live befor them untrammel would you think anyth other than that they were just misguid fool arletti play the part of prostitut well she kept that zipper on her dress busi throughout anyway i ve onli seen a few film with jouvet he is the most impress invent a pimp in hdn my troubl is shallow everi time i see his face i think of sonni hale in evergreen a remark atmospher well act and photograph film with so much happen it need a few view to get it all in place annabella and aumont made an except beauti coupl francoi heurtebis perier in his nd film had a small amus part a a gay man all in all wonder 
 
 
 
 hotel du nord is the onli carn movi from the era which ha dialog not written by jacqu pr vert but by henri jeanson janson wa much more interest in the jouvet arletti coupl than in the pair of lover annabella aumont the latter is rather bland and their stori recal odd the edith piaf s song le amant d un jour except that the chanteus s tale is a tragic one what s fascin today is this popular littl world the canal saint martin set this movi is dear to the french movi buff for anoth veri special reason the pimp jouvet tell his prot g e raymond he want a chang of air atmosph re becaus she doe not understand the mean of the world atmosph re the whore raymond wonder arletti think it s an insult and she deliv this line that is undeni the most famous of the whole french cin ma in french atmosph re atmosph re est ce que j ai une gueul d atmosph re translat attempt atmospher atmospher have i got an atmospher face this is our french nobodi s perfect 
 
 
 
this version of anna christi is in german greta garbo again play anna christi but all of the other charact have differ actor from the english version both were film back to back becaus garbo had such a follow in germani garbo herself suppos favor her anna christi in this version over the english version it s a good tale and a must see for garbo fan

i like the good and evil battl i like eddi in this movi better than ani movi he ha ever done he wasn t the smart cocki know it all he usual play he show heart and a more humbl humor the fact that it show there are stranger thing in heaven and on earth than we can think of give me hope 
 
 
 
this movi is one of my favourit it is a genr mixtur with ingredi of the action horror romant comedygenr some of the special effect may seem outdat compar to modern standard this minor flaw is easili ignor there is so much to discov in this stori the romant relat between the two main charact is so beauti that it hurt the visual are beauti too the action is great which is no surpris it is origin from honkong birthplac of the world s best action movi the humour sometim seem a littl bit silli but in a good way somehow this movi is be abl to balanc the differ mood and keep be good absolut recommend 
 
 
 
this is the best chine movi i have ever seen and in my opinion a lot better than hero or chrouch tiger hidden dragon the movi is a uniqu combin of sever genr it s a beauti love stori action movi comedi and horror at the same time and the most amaz thing is that it realli succeed in all of this this movi definit make it to my top and should be enjoy to everi movi lover the action sequenc do have the tradit unrealist jump and even fli but the way it s shot differ from the style of hero a lot and the fli alway look great and usual even make sen ghost can fli see this movi you won t regret it 
 
 
 
this movi is incred with great charact special the old swordsman that can fli in the shape of firebal and jump across the tree this film tell a classic stori of battl between good and forc of evil the final showdown is special breathtak and the music score is kinda cool veri veri recommend not for the smallest child though this one deserv a

be someon who list night of the live dead at number three in her top five favorit movi of all time and at the same time love this student film parodi i feel i must defend this movi against the previous post scath review this short but sweet opus ha alway been a crowd pleaser at horror and scienc fiction movi marathon where those who attend have a love of the genr yet know not to take zombi movi too serious this film is a tribut to the origin not an insult it is intend to be funni and mani other who i have heard chant for and applaud it agre with me that it succeed especi for those of u who have seen notld time watch for the director cameo a news report jeff drexel and also if you have the opportun catch his alien parodi loaf 
 
 
 
have seen the short a number of time at horror movi marathon i believ it to be a humor parodi that slice to the main point of it refer though the theme are crusti and stale to today s viewer it is by no mean a crumbi wast of time though be a student film give littl rise to an excus the proof is that it appear craft with care on a budget of littl to no dough a note by anoth review it is le than ten minut which is plenti of time to clean the view palat with a toast of joy sit back and loaf idl through the film i think this short bread of a film should be enjoy a an appet for the titl refer and the viewer should relax and roll with it

although lang s version is more famous borzag s work is not devoid of interest far from it it celesti sequenc are even better the metaphor of the train perhap borrow from the end of abel ganc s la roue is eventu more convinc than the up abov heaven world borzag s tender for his charact show in mari s charact and love beyond the grave is one of his favorit subject the end of three comrad the amus park seem to be everywher we see it even when we are in mari s poor hous i do not think that the set are that much cheesi they are styliz to a fault the fair from a distanc almost give a sci fi feel to the movi borzag never forget his social concern in the heaven train go up the rich cannot stand to be mix up with the riffraff but a chief magistr tell here there s no more differ not a major work for borzag neither is lang s version but to seek out if you are interest in the great director s career 
 
 
 
the sea is watch ha been made from an origin akira kurosawa script and it is inde a lush and warm film watch it will be a pleasur kei kumai a director is certain no equal to the old but everlast master particular the mass scene in the begin of the film ha some terribl act but the overal mood and sceneri is veri enjoy anoth thing that is miss here kurosawa alway manag to let the charact be so much more then what they are actual show and do probabl that wa his magic on set while shoot and just mayb this script wa not fulli up to par yet mayb we just miss the eye of the master this is one love and sweet film but it is no kurosawa to expect that might well be veri silli 
 
 
 
kurosawa weav a tale that ha a cast of charact a diver a ani shakespearean drama and the act is true to the stori with each star play their role a a part of the larger tale it is touch funni and intrigu in all part the charact develop is near perfect the cinematographi is vivid and engag and the stori draw you in i would like to say that the samurai freak and those ob with late th and th centuri dynast tale of japan may snub this film a not kurosawa s best work perhap not his best but even at his worst kurosawa is better than mani of the best this stori is so base in elev the mundan live of ordinari peopl in a time of great chang that it is timeless despit be set in the not so distant past i would heartili recommend this to ani movi buff and especi to those who are like to continu on to read the novel on which the film is base

a tragic wonder movi bring u to a japan that doe not exist anymor despit hollywood s technic expertis i have yet to see a hollywood movi that can match the authent of the atmospher in this small town by the river near the sea tom cruis s the last samurai look like the last instal of the lord of the ring in tri to captur rural old japan if you like seren but intens stori line this is a must see film it will be a respit from hollow flashi film much like the last blockbust you saw i think this is one of kurosawa s better stori even if it s a movi about geisha and brothel and the complic rule that govern life in such set it did not turn into a skin flick the charact are full of depth and act with much intens 
 
 
 
a wonder film to watch with astonish scene and talent actor such a misa shimizu and nagiko tono after minut of watch your eye get lock on the screen and you do noth but breath in the atmospher of the film wait what the destini will bring to the charact this film make you leav your posit a a standard audienc it take you in it make you a part of the stori costum and set are brilliant especi the district of the okiya is skill built it is definit not veri akira kurosawa howev it still get a lot from the master especi the stylist stori tell tell u we re in a distinguish land of cinema which is quit far from hollywoodish flamboy 
 
 
 
i can understand those who dislik this movi caus of a lack of knowledg first of all those girl are not geisha but brothel tenant and one that don t know the differ will not understand half of the movi and certain not the end this is a complet art work about the woman s life and need in this era everyth is import and certain the way they dress all over the movi mean more than word to those who thought it wa a bore geisha movi i ll suggest you to read a bit about this societi befor make a conclus that is so out of the realiti this is kurosawa s work of is life and i m sure that the director understood the silent mean of kurosawa s piec to the right intellectu rang 
 
 
 
contrari to some peopl s summari the woman depict in the film are not geisha they are oiran prostitut live outsid the most famous pleasur district and their live and experi repres the live of a great number of tokugawa era woman i can t say the stori were particular enlighten but their charm lie in just how typic they are the theme are univers and everyday love friendship and sacrific i did great enjoy the art direct and the act i felt like i wa get a glimps of a time and place i can never otherwis glimps the actor especi the woman who play the main oiran were a thrill to watch i d onli recommend this movi to peopl who want a tast of japanes cultur or to those who enjoy quiet and emot stori it s a great exampl of both 
 
 
 
i realli like this movi and went back to see it two time more within a week m detmer nail the perform she wa like a hungri cat on the prowl toy with her prey she lash out in rage and lust take a too young lover and crash hundr of her terrorist fianc s mother s piec of fine china to the floor the film wa full of beauti touch the maserati the wonder wardrob the flower box along the rooftop i particular enjoy the ancient greek class and the recit of antigon it had a feel of stori of o that is where peopl of mean indulg in unrestrain sexual adventur a she walk around the fantast apart in the buff she is at ea and whi not what is to restrain a devil in the flesh the whole movi is a real treat 
 
 
 
the movi is far more sophist and intellig is it explor of sexual tension than such american attempt a and a half week the courtroom scene itself with the coupl copul in the cage while the heroin plead for their orgasm is amaz i have not seen this movi in year but it made indel pictur in my mind it is rich in textur and success in creat a world where sex is the engin for all activ and at it bottom is the yawn angst that live in u all the plot is european and it meander a bit but so doe life especi when you are and have a constant hard on 
 
 
 
i m surpris that no one yet ha mention that there are two version of this same film the lion s share of the footag in both is ident but here is where they differ in one version the version i have seen most often on broadcast tv the group of cleric guard the gateway consist of the brotherhood of the protector a fiction splinter group of priest and brother excommun by the church in the other version which i ve seen onli onc on tv the cleric guard the gateway are depict a priest of the offici church mean the archdioces of new york or perhap brooklyn also in the former version in most of the pertin scene the cleric are refer to a brother and in some scene you can see where the lip say father so and so but the dub audio say brother so and so in the latter version i believ everyon is refer to a father in ani event it seem that one of these two version is more or le a partial re shoot of the other with all brotherhood of the protector scene re shot a archdioces scene or vice versa kind of remind me of the raymond burr cutaway scene in godzilla i have videotap both version off broadcast tv so no i m not imagin this can anyon shed some more light on the stori behind these two version of the film

i m not sure whi this littl film ha been banish into obscur a despit some rather silli go on the sentinel is a clever and invent horror film that give most of the high prais ghost stori of today more than a run for their money michael winner ha admit mani time that he s not the best director of all time and that doe shine through on a number of occas with this film but it ha to be said that the film work in spite of it s uninspir direct and the fact that winner ha somehow manag to round up a simpli amaz cast of talent more than make up for it the plot is rich with mysteri and begin by focus on alison parker and her hunt for a flat she find that she can t afford most properti she look at but think her luck ha chang when she find a fulli furnish apart for an afford price her problem start soon after move in a she doesn t like her neighbour veri much and this problem increas when the properti broker tell her that she ha just one neighbour an elder blind priest on the top floor the cast list is truli superb with the relat unknown cristina rain head up a great support cast chris sarandon is a littl wooden in his role opposit rain but small part for the like of john carradin eli wallach ava gardner jeff goldblum and christoph walken to name but a hand more than make up for sarandon s lifeless portray michael winner doe a good job with his central locat a the block of flat provid a creepi and macabr set for the stori the film is a littl slow to start but it s never bore and michael winner s screenplay provid a surpris that s almost imposs to guess from the offset which certain deserv some prais like mani similar slow burn horror this one doesn t go for the money shot earli on but unlik mani the end is a definit climax a winner goe all out to shock the viewer and if the rumour that he use actual human odditi is true i ve got to say that he doe a veri good job at it overal while this film may be pure hokum whichev way you look at it the sentinel is one of the better film of it type and it s definit a major highlight for it director 
 
 
 
boast an all star cast so impress that it almost seem like the mad mad mad mad world of horror pictur the sentinel is nevertheless an effect creepi film center on the relat unknown actress cristina rain in this one she play a fashion model alison parker who move into a brooklyn height brownston that is and i don t think i m give away too much at this late date veri close to the gateway of hell and a a tenant in this build she suffer far wors condit than leaki plumb and the occasion water bug to put it mild inde the scene in which alison encount her noisi upstair neighbor is truli terrifi and should certain send the ice water cours down the spine of most viewer despit mani critic complaint regard rain act abil i thought she wa just fine more than abli hold her own in scene with ava gardner burgess meredith arthur kennedi chris sarandon and eli wallach the pictur build to an effect eeri conclus and although some plot point go unexplain i wa left feel more than satisfi a the book dvd delirium put it ani movi with bever d angelo and sylvia mile a topless cannib lesbian in leotard can t be all bad on a side note yesterday i walk over to montagu terrac in brooklyn height to take a look at the sentinel hous yes it s still there and although shorn of it heavi coat of ivi and lack a blind priest nun at the top floor window look much the same a it did in this pictur if this hous realli doe sit atop the entranc to hell i take it that hell is the brooklyn queen expressway but we new yorker have known that for some time

a young woman who is a success model and is also engag to be marri and who ha twice attempt suicid in the past is chosen by a secret and distant associ of cathol priest to be the next sentinel to the gateway to hell which appar goe through a creepi old but well maintain brooklyn apart build it tenant take the stairway up and can reincarn themselv but appar can t escap a long a a sentinel is there to block the way the previous one john carradin is about dead so she by fate or whatev becom the next one and the doom must get her to kill herself in order for them to be free lot of interest detail lie under the surfac her relationship with her father the stori of the doom her fianc so one can pas this off a cheap exploit horror but given the set the great cast and overal level of bizarr this is definit worth see 
 
 
 
sigh i sincer wonder whi all the acclaim and suppos profound movi critic hold such a grudg against director michael winner sure he isn t the avatar of subtleti a his film are practic alway hard hand and confront but so what they re awesom entertain his most famous action movi like the first three entri in the death wish seri for exampl are easi target to clobber down becaus they alleg glorifi violenc and the person use of shotgun but even when winner take on far more matur cinema genr like the religi horror of the sentinel for exampl he doesn t stand a chanc with ani of the critic the sentinel generat some controversi and infuri sever peopl upon it releas when it leak that michael winner cast genuin malform and handicap peopl to portray the creatur attempt to cross the gateway between hell and earth pretti much the exact same controversi caus todd s brown s masterpiec and landmark in horror cinema freak to remain ban and unseen for over thirti year and whi just becaus certain prudish and easili offend peopl who shouldn t watch the movi in the first place claim it s an uneth thing to do i don t suppos michael winner or todd brown held these peopl at gunpoint or forc them to appear in their film so what give u the right to feel embarrass in their place anoth major reason whi critic didn t warm welcom the sentinel is becaus jeffrey konvitz novel and thus michael winner s screenplay is huge deriv of other contemporari but far more success religi theme horror stori and thus accord to the merciless pen of horror critic littl more than pure plagiar admit the sentinel borrow multipl substanti element from rosemari s babi the omen and the exorcist but let s face it s cinema larg thrive on stolen formula and imit success stori if you overlook the slight unorigin concept and in all fair a hand of thorough confus and unnecessari sub plot the sentinel honest still remain a uniqu atmospher and often downright petrifi s horror highlight with an impress ensembl cast and nightmarish imageri you re not like to forget easi alison parker a ravish model with some unprocess mental trauma move into a stun brownston apart in brooklyn deepli against the will of her boyfriend michael who propos to wed her sever time alreadi alison s physic exist and especi her mental condit drastic alter short after and the omin apart appear to be the root of all miseri she meet eccentr neighbor and attend birthday parti for their cat even though the landladi claim she and a blind priest are the onli tenant she frequent faint dure her work assign and ha truli creepi vision of her bastard father and the night she attempt to commit suicid it slowli becom clear that alison got chosen to serv a higher supernatur purpos insid this apart build but simultan malign forc tri and prevent this it s truli regrett how the promot taglin and even brief synopsi on the back of the dvd immedi reveal that alison s brownston apart is the earth s gateway to hell itself and she s the chosen one to guard it becaus the film s script onli slowli build up toward this shock revel for near minut and throughout some sad tedious and overlong sequenc michael winner success maintain the impress that alison s own mind is play trick with her and that the involv of the cathol church and her fianc e s odd behavior are strict red herring multipl of the horrif scene come pretti close to be genius like alison s flashback or her first acquaint with the priest upstair the whole climax with the controversi guest appear mention here abov is a liter perplex showcas of pure terror and easili one of the most unforgett and nail bite denouement i ever wit the cast michael winner manag to gather is deepli impress especi consid the sentinel still remain a legitim horror movi and this genr isn t the most popular among promin actor but of cours you also have to put the cast list a littl into perspect with such an extend cast obvious sever of the role in the film are littl more than cameo martin balsam and john carradin for exampl onli appear on screen for a coupl of minut all togeth sever other like christoph walken jeff goldblum bever d angelo and tom bereng perhap add a lot of fame to the movi nowaday but back when it wa releas they were still too unknown in order to attract curious viewer my person pick for best perform go to burgess meredith a the uncanni neighbor and eli wallach a the satir polic inspector the relat unknown cristina rain doe an admir job carri the film and chris sarandon neat back her up even though he sport a ridicul mustach in my humbl opinion the sentinel is a marvel entertain and frighten horror movi and most definit a must see for true genr fanat 
 
 
 
man i realli love the new dvd that univers put out i ve never seen the sentinel look this good sinc i had to put up with crappi graini vhs tape for year unfortun there are no extra beyond a trailer that look pretti wors for wear and avoid the goodtim dvd at all cost it suck anyway troubl fashion model alison parker cristina rain move into haunt nyc brownston onli it s more than just haunt it s also a portal to hell and the vatican keep an old blind priest john carradin to keep watch over it and make sure the devil and arch angel don t escap this ha an all star cast full of old timey actor like ava gardner arthur kennedi jose ferrer etc a well a cameo of upcom s star includ christoph walken jeff goldblum who s voic wa mysteri overdub and tom bereng and you won t even recogn jerri orbach from law order i had to do a doubl take when i didn t quit place where i d seen him befor nice gore scene of alison slice the eye and nose off her dead father s rot corp that s been posse by the devil and there s a neat end where disfigur deform peopl tri to haunt alison into commit suicid so she won t be the next one to guard the portal it seem alison s troubl past make her a prime candid by the vatican to becom the next sentinel an excel creepi s classic from director michael winner that shouldn t be miss i also recommend it for those who want someth a littl more imagin beyond the usual stupid teenag slasher and horror comedi out of 
 
 
 
 the sentinel is one of the best horror movi alreadi made in the movi s industri i think it is veri scari a veri few movi actual are alison parker is a model with some fame she date a lawyer call michael lerman and ha a a best friend anoth model call jennif everyth wa great in her life until she decid to live alon for some time and rent a beauti and old apart the problem are her neighbor who are veri veri strang sudden alison start to have health problem and faint with frequenc she also rememb some pain fact about her past that make her have nightmar or illus but everyth ha a reason and it ha to do with the new hous she is live i person find the sentinel a veri creepi movi and along with the exorcist they are two of the scariest movi i alreadi watch when we discov that alison s hous is onli occupi by the priest and herself my blood froze it s also horribl to see that she need to becom blind in the end of the movi in order to be the new sentinel to keep the monster away from our world 
 
 
 
bore with the normal run of the mill stapl film to watch this halloween that i ve seen over and over again i took a chanc on the sentinel hope it could get my horror juic flow again mind you i had just come back from see the dark castl remak of the hous on haunt hill complet and utter crap thank the sentinel blew me away in a rivit stori about a model who move into a creepi build in brooklyn hight the film offer everyth that i hope to find in a good movi campi and fantas juici charact exchang and dialogu includ hilarai turn by christoph walken jeff goldblum and especi martin balsam a an absent mind professor horrifi terror not to give a frame away but there are scene in this film that chill me to my pancrea fantast gore terrif make up and wacki if veri uneven direct from michael winner which flow rather nice with this unreal treat if you love evil dead dead aliv and deep rise this will be your queen of favourit just to emphas my love for this film after i watch it for the first time jaw drop i rewound it and watch it again it is now one of favourit of all time do yourself a favour and check it out 
 
 
 
for those that were interest in know how exact human came to be encas in big red pod that make me crave pomegran there is the duo of the second renaiss short i m not exact sure whi they are split into two part especi sinc they re credit a one on the dvd and are these short view on ani other format but the dvd but they re inform even if they have a few gap what realli make this first part stand out from the second part and the rest of the anim a well is the parallel it show between robot upris and civil right graphic homag to slaveri fascism concentr camp and mass grave are mix with verbal refer to the million man march and human s god complex in fact god is never realli referenc by these short instead replac by man s own imag a far a the short go in the collect the second renaiss part i is by far the most effect in bring out emot it s a sorrow and disturb view of the potenti of human to becom the architect of it own destruct some may be turn off by some of the concept this short rip direct out of previous establish scienc fiction literatur but then again that s basic what most of the matrix seri ha done and it s been a drive forc behind it success polarisdib
 
 
 
along with it s partner this is the greatest piec of anim ever creat the imag and style are amaz and match perfect with the stori which is a brilliant realist reinterpret of our own world where is ha been and where it could go quit affect and sometim pain to watch it it a masterpiec of the visual art 
 
 
 
this is the second part of the animatrix a collect of anim short movi that tell u a littl more about the world of the matrix in this one we learn how men and machin could not work and live togeth it is a littl histori lesson in the world of the matrix not a good a the first part the final flight of the osiri but still pretti entertain 
 
 
 
the first time you see the second renaiss it may look bore look at it at least twice and definit watch part it will chang your view of the matrix are the human peopl the one who start the war is ai a bad thing 
 
 
 
what wa alway miss with the matrix stori wa how thing came to be in the real world say no more becaus this part of the stori cover most of the base what wa truli interest wa how polit it wa mayb even a cheap shot at the current presidenti administr fascism and violenc were the onli thing man could think of in regard to fight the robot hord who were meant a noth more than servant to human what i also found interest wa the use of fear and how it wa perpetu by the idea of the unknown we a human tend to fall into that trap quit often let the lack of logic and thought overtak u becaus peopl can t believ the contrari well repres and put togeth this a true testament to how illog human can be 
 
 
 
i think the movi wa pretti good will add it to my clasic collect after all this time i believ i saw other poster who remind some of the pickier peopl that it is still just a movi mayb some of the more esoter point defi logic but a great mani religi matter accept on faith fail to pas the smell test if you re go to accept whatev faith you subscrib to you can certain accept a movi is it just me or ha anyon el notic the aja yee dagger is the same posse knife lamont cranston had so much troubl gain control of in the shadow no mention of it in the trivia section for either movi here imdb but i would bet a dollar to a donut it s the same prop 
 
 
 
you d be forgiven to think a finnish director from helsinki would be no good at direct an american horror movi especi one entir locat insid a u prison see this to prove yourself wrong it wa produc in the s after all and the film wa made on a budget more fit to a modern diy compani tv advert someth i think anyon would realli notic nowaday what with practic everyon be accustom to m budget for action movi unfortun domin the industri mind be mr harlin s first major product and the at least what nowaday would be consid a stellar cast i still think most of the nordic contribut to the film industri a a whole is more to do with stellan stargaard s screen appear not mention the well overr mr s bergman directori effort at least for all femal viewer but this flick realli prove there doe exist proper movi talent outsid of the u and hollywood to make u watch a film in suspens do tri and watch this movi even if you re not a horror puff imo it s definit worth it 
 
 
 
caught this film in about on video by chanc and without know what i wa in for mani horror fan may have miss this think it wa a typic prison film and the one who did get it didn t like it a it wa not what they want to see the abov mention factor are probabl the reason it is low rate but just ignor that and give it a whirl if you re a fan of the genr it ha strong suit in all depart from script and atmospher to act and the prison itself an absolut diamond a film i still have on video to this day check it out 
 
 
 
i pull down a vhs box from my vast collect mani unseen and pick out a movi base on the box art i thought would be fun and yes bad prison had that s cheesi look all over that box i sat down and watch and lo and behold found that sometim we do inde sit down to a movi with preconceiv expect in mind fortun i revers mine quick and soon realiz i wa sit down not just to an okay film but a rather good movi in total prison tell the stori of an old dilapid prison be reopen to save on budgetari concern it look creepi a all empti and fill with prison the prison use a a set is incred atmospher and easili the most import charact in the film the stori use the prison a it central set tell in a prologu of a man be kill via the electr chair we see lane smith a a guard tear away a crucifix befor send the man to his maker we then go to present day first with a govern board at a meet decid to open the prison and send a beauti doctor in to make sure that condit are accept a she campaign vigor against re open the old prison then we see the new warden lane smith haunt by a nightmar in bed and given the new job of open a prison he ha not been to in year well the rest follow suit prison and guard arriv with plenti of stereotyp abound we are given some charact depth and sever of the prison are interest charact the act is better than one might expect with lane smith do a alway a workmanlik job viggo mortenson a a veri differ prison be solid tom everett tini lister and ivan kane realli explor the boundari of their stereotyp charact chelsea field is okay a the femal lead the best perform is by lincoln kilpatrick an underr charact actor a cresus a prison who had been in that veri same prison year ago when the man had been execut with some kind of terribl secret prison is not the next best thing to slice bread or anyth like that but it is definit worth a look and definit better than most would expect from it i wa pleasant surpris at the way director renni harlin creat a stori so visual atmospher the film ha a ten taut pace and harlin know how to build his scene there are a few excess shot gore scene the one with the barb wire wa a bit much a wa the one with all the pipe but these scene are visual creativ and interest the act is uniform decent the script actual much more cohes than one usual get from film like these that may in part be credit to irwin yablan who wrote the stori you may rememb he came up with the idea of make halloween scari a a holiday here he make incarcer a hell of a lot more scarier than it alreadi is give prison a break get it 
 
 
 
stori of a wrong execut prison who haunt the prison he wa electrocut in and kill random prison while wait to take reveng on the man who frame him viggo mortensen is great and the act is pretti good overal lane smith is delici wick a the guilti warden also this film ha some great gore includ death by barb wire mummif

veri smart sometim shock i just love it it shove one more side of david s brilliant talent he impress me great david is the best the movi captiv your attent for everi second 
 
 
 
this movi realli kick some as i watch it over and over and it never got bore angelina joli realli kick some as in the movi you should see the movi you won t be disappoint and anoth reason you should see the movi is becaus the guy from the x file is in it david duchovni 
 
 
 
like i said it a hidden surpris it well written well act and well cast i like everyth in this movi look it hollywood all right but the brighter side angelina joli is great in this and i m total watch everi movi with her in that i can get my hand on well worth a look 
 
 
 
this film ha a lot of raw potenti the script is sharp the dialogu is usual excel though it could stand to lose the cheezi voic over the direct and cinematographi is surpris quit good though some of the experiment just doesn t work the main problem here is david duchovni onc a geek boy alway a geek boy and the sad simpl fact is that he s incap of play anyth but fox mulder he postur he tri to be slick he pose he tri to be macho in the end he just tri too hard he overplay his charact he overspeak his line and he s just outplay in all way by timothi hutton and angelina joli who are each in a class abov him in term of act skill timothi hutton wa a alway realli good there wa a spotti moment or two where he over dramat his role but you could tell he wa have fun with it he look the part and he becam the charact both physic and atmospher angelina joli wa also realli good she didn t have much of a role in fact i though she could have use a much stronger one her charact wasn t near develop enough though she did remark well with what she had and the chemistri between her and hutton wa appar gee mayb that s whi uma left him all in all it wa rough around the edg but a solid effort by a good cast and great support role if david duchovni hadn t rip his role to piec it would ve been that much better 
 
 
 
i enjoy this movi unlik like some of the pump up steroid trash that is pas off a action movi play god is simpl and realist with charact that are believ action that is not over the top and enough twist and turn to keep you interest until the end well direct well act and a good stori 
 
 
 
david duchovni play the lead role in this film now a lot of peopl upon find that fact out wouldn t even bother watch it veri unfair to say the least david made his name on the x file and is a decent actor dr eugen sand duchovni is a drug addict doctor struck off for malpractic by sheer accid he becom a privat doctor for crimin millionair raymond blossom howev the fbi take an interest in use eugen to snare blossom angelina joli is cast in the support role of clare the gangster moll she put in a solid perform timothi hutton play blossom is superb and immers himself deepli into his charact duchovni himself isn t a bad a mani peopl would think and in the end i would rate his perform his credibl his familiar monoton tone and straight face is present but dosen t detract too much from the film
 
 
 
i love this film it is well written and act and ha good cinematographi the stori blend action humor mystic and tender with great set and beauti locat shot see it buy it show it to your friend the act is good and murphi especi doe a fine job portray the reluct unlik hero i enjoy all the charact and found them to be interest and well develop with dynam interact i care what happen to these peopl and while the outcom wa pretti predict the good guy win the hero get the astonish attract girl and the holi child save live who doesn t see that come it still made me happi when everyth work out well in the end thank god this film s digniti wa never ruin with a crappi sequel grab some popcorn cuddl up on the couch and watch this fun happi and entertain film 
 
 
 
okay truth i saw the preview for this movi and thought to myself what are the produc think hutton joli and duchovni how could the monoton actor possibl compet with joli s natur power on the screen but surpris the two had the kind of chemistri that show intens care without a kiss even david s humor match up to joli s spark and fire a for hutton he play the psycho veri well contrast with david s calm deliveri of life threaten situat overal i wa veri impress with the write and charact develop i gave it star 
 
 
 
while the main stori is suppos to take place in morocco this movi wa shot in foggi romania in day on a veri tight budget howev broken their card may be the actor and the crew play them with remark skill and commit so that in the end i found the result both touch and grace nikolaj coaster waldau provid a formid perform a the bad guy the script and direct provid some gem whether you will like the movi or not howev will probabl depend on your take on alexandra staden in the titl role other review have point out staden s inadequaci a modesti blais they may have a point but i found her interpret delight and veri fit modesti manag to overcom terribl odd through disciplin innat talent and courag staden appear to be do the same here 
 
 
 
everi onc in a while eddi murphi will surpris you in a movi like the golden child especi this is a movi you d figur would star mayb harrison ford or kurt russel or someon but eddi realli doe work he s smart he s funni he s brave kind courteous thrifti clean and everyth el a hero should be have been chosen to secur a mystic child who hold the key to protect the world from complet evil embodi perfect by danc eddi goe from california to nepal and back all while the beauti kee nang lewi wonder if he s all he say he is and a crazi old holi man wong perfect a alway know that he is it s excit breathtak in spot shock and of cours funni eddi is the onli action hero i know who could begin a movi by make rude remark behind some guy read a porno magazin and end it with smart aleck remark about ed mcmahon no problem with this child it s a golden find nine star viva nepal 
 
 
 
this wa the modesti that we didn t know it wa hint at and summar in the comic strip for the syndic to sell to newspap lee and janet batchler were true modesti blais fan who were given the dream job tell a prequel stori of modesti that the fan never saw befor in their audio commentari they admit that that they made chang in her origin to make the stori run smoother the purist should also note that we realli don t know if everyth she told miklo wa true becaus she wa stall for time i didn t rent or borrow the dvd like other review did i bought it and i don t want a refund i watch it three time and i didn t sleep through it great dialog and well drawn charact that i care about even bad guy miklo just like in the novel and comic strip i too can t wait for the next modesti and willi film especi if this prequel is a sign of what s to come 
 
 
 
first off i m a dedic fan of modesti s and have been read the comic sinc i wa a child and i have found the earlier movi about our heroin unsatisfi but where they fail this one rock well then here we go m blais is work for a casino a gang of robber come along and she start gambl for her friend live if the robber win one round she ll have to tell him about herself if she win two time in a row one of the staff member goe free sound stupid yeah well i m not that good at explain either she tell him about grow up in a war zone without parent or friend about her help an old man in the refuge camp and how they escap live by natur s own rule they hunt for food and he teach her to read and fight a they approach civil they get caught up in a war and a they are taken for rebellion they are be shot at and the old man die which leav her to meet the citi by herself then she meet the man who s casino she s now work for and there the stori end what is to follow is that there s an awesom fight and the line s are total cool alexandra staden is a terrif modesti blais just a modest and strong grace and intellectu a the comic one feel awkward though too hear modesti speak with a slight broken accent but that s not relev sinc the comic book blais can t speak out loud but certain must have a somewhat exist accent not to mention that it s weird everybodi s speak english in the balkan the act is realli good even the child who personifi the young blais must have a applaud my favorit part must be where she rip up her dress to kick the stupid robber s as total awesom d i can t wait until the real adventur begin in the next movi s watch it you won t be disappoint 
 
 
 
i first saw this movi on televis some year ago and frank love it charl danc make one of the most terrifi villain anyon can imagin his sophist is such a perfect contrast to the crude good hero i have never been much of an eddi murphi fan but find his irrit portray here a winner a bit of axel foley through the look glass charlott lewi is to util a hackney phrase but the onli one applic lumin gorgeous some scene are wonder creat the dream sequenc the bird the silli fight scene and the climact confront through it all murphi is the modern man sudden drop into an orient myth a stun and quieter version of kurt russel in his orient fantasi romp like that movi we have jame hong the incompar actor whose scene howev short rais the qualiti even of derek sinc hong ha defin the fine support actor the class act of his profess the golden child is silli it is not perfect but it ha so mani redeem featur that it is an enjoy and amus fantasi well worth watch after four year i have seen the golden child again i enjoy it even more it truli is great fun 
 
 
 
magellan said you can onli do so much when the two star of the show can onli be seen by one fellow cast member i assum then that you never heard of topper which in addit to the two star who could onli be seen by one member of the cast had a dog ditto this wa the kind of program that had not gonna make it written allov it from the first episod it wa like an arcad video game where you actual have to read the instruct to play no one well veri few of u appar want to watch a comedi program that ha a basic premis that actual requir thought to grasp 
 
 
 
i use to watch this show when i wa a littl girl although i don t rememb much about it i must say that it wa a pretti good show also i don t think i ve seen everi episod howev if you ask me it wa still a good show i vagu rememb the theme song everyon wa ideal cast the costum design wa great the perform were top grade too i just hope some network bring this seri back one day so that i ll be abl to see everi episod befor i wrap this up i d like to say that i ll alway rememb this show in my memori forev even though i don t think i ve seen everi episod now in conclus when and if this show is ever brought back on the air i hope that you catch it one day befor it goe off the air for good

this movi is defin one of my favourit movi in it s kind the interact between respect and moral uncorrupt charact is an ode to chivalri and the honour code amongst thiev and policeman it treat theme like duti guilt word manipul and trust like few film have done and unfortun none that i can recal sinc the death of the polici in the late seventi the sequenc is delici down to the essenti live noth out and thus lead the spectat into a master plot right and wrong without accessori eye catch and spectacular scene that are often need in lesser specimen of the genr in order to keep the audienc awak no such scene are present or need the argument is flowless and honest to the spectat wich is an import asset in a genr in wich the the suspens is often achiev through the betrail of the audienc no this is not miss marbl a note of congratul for the music is in order a film to watch and savour everi minut not just to see 
 
 
 
whenev i see most review it s call a misfir for eddi murphi these critic want to take a look at some of the stuff he s do these day and mayb soften their stanc in retrospect the golden child is not highbrow entertain but thank to some of the cast it breath new life into old clich s and give murphi one of his best role i don t understand the pervad lack of love for it effort at all perhap it wa releas at a time when the establish had grown weari of knockabout thrill a minut adventur steven spielberg start it with indiana jone it s unfair to make this one a scapegoat when what is possibl it biggest sin is also utter harmless there s noth necessarili wrong with tri to capitalis on trend yes it s silli but even an occasion observ should be abl to understand that ridicul is where hollywood s idea of mystic begin and end what s more import than believ with a stori like this is that the audienc have entertain tour guid on hand to show them the mysteri sight michael ritchi and eddi murphi fit the bill for this capac just fine my advic to you is to buy the ticket and take the ride 
 
 
 
farewel friend aka adieu l ami honour among thiev isn t perfect but it is a neat and entertain thriller that see mismatch demob french algerian war veteran alain delon and charl bronson trap in the same basement vault one to return stolen bond the other to clean out the two million in wage sit there over the christma weekend natur thing aren t quit that simpl even after they open the vault lead to some neat twist and turn on the debit side there s a veri bizarr stripteas scene in a car park bronson ha a veri irrit fonzi like catchphras he use at the most inopportun moment brigitt fossey sport perhap the most hideous misconceiv hairstyl of the s it make her look like a bald woman whose wig is blown back off the top of her head by a high wind is someth of a liabil her i ll cook spaghetti i ll learn to make love well i ll read shakespear speech is hyster in all the wrong way and it s a shame about the horribl last line shot but otherwis this is a surpris entertain and unpretenti number that s worth check out if you can find a decent print cinema club s uk dvd onli offer the english soundtrack but sinc delon voic himself and the rest of the cast are fair well dub that s no great problem especi sinc the widescreen transfer is pretti good qualiti 
 
 
 
noni hazlehurst colin friel alic garner chrissi amphlett and michael caton what more could you ask for monkey grip base on the prize win novel of the same name explor nora hazlehurst a singl mother fall for a heroin addict jobe friel a simpl stori is made truli extraordinari through the all round magnific act in particular noni hazlehurst and nice use of the small budget the onli flaw is if you can pick it up is that the stori is set in melbourn although for budget reason the film wa main shot in sydney so a a result in a few scene you see tram melbourn scene and then a carlton post offic sydney scene other than that monkey grip is a must see excus the cliqu but it is at least for an award win perform from former play school and better home garden present noni hazlehurst 
 
 
 
i definit recommend read the book prior to watch the film this book won nation book council award in and is a veri grip read pun not intend it s not too difficult to read for those out there that don t read often so don t be afraid the book seem to captur the passion of the relationship more so than the movi and the movi will make more sen after read the book have grown up in melbourn i could realli relat to this book and movi veri few australian femal writer were around the in the s therefor veri littl is document about the way of life for a woman in an urban citi in australia dure this era or class it s a precious piec of melbourn histori it s a shame that it is document a some sort of s soft porn movi it s far from that and a the other review ha mention plea do not read the dvd jacket it doe not repres what the movi is about at all those that rent the movi base on this descript will onli be disappoint just rememb this movi wa made in so don t expect the hollywood over dramat that they seem to incorpor these day this is what i like about it it s also great see noni hazlehurst in this role she is just fantast a nora and it s great watch her realli act for if you re close to my age you will best rememb her for her stint on playschool and better home and garden who knew she hid this talent this movi will give you an entir new impress of her a classic australian stori 
 
 
 
if jean renoir s first film whirlpool of fate first take u into the world of the countrysid the river the live of the peasantri that he will continu to explor it seem onli fit that his second film deal for the most part with the wealthi and the privileg the upper class and those who are tri to claw their way upward put the charact from the first two film togeth and you have the seed of his great grand illus and rule of the game this is beauti film with the restless camera make full use of the amaz huge apart and backstag area that domin the film s interior and the act though frequent overwrought offer some great moment a well particular from werner krauss muffat but the glamor and sultri m hessl who at first appear a if she might give louis brook a run for her money in vampish never goe beyond a one note selfish harlot portray perhap this is in part a problem with the script which doe seem to most go for high point and outrag emot not have read the novel i m not realli clear on whether the choic were well made or not still the differ between nana s suitor are well drawn and i particular like the relationship between muffat and jean angelo s vandeuvr the tragic understand that each seem to have of his ultim fate and their sympathi with each other particular in the scene at the bottom of the enorm staircas where vandeuvr warn muffat and we wonder if violenc will erupt this and other glean of the ridicul of the idl rich help give the film the depth it ha far from his greatest achiev and for me probabl just shi overal of whirlpool of fate this is still well worth see for renoir fan or those interest in silent cinema general 
 
 
 
the premis may seem goofi but sinc murphi s charact doesn t take it serious it help ea the audienc into this mix of mystic and modern day hard boil child abduct excel cast particular charl danc and charlott lewi and murphi is at the height of his s peak in comedi action there s also some great f x a veri surreal dream sequenc and a fair origin plot often overlook in the pantheon of murphi flick but this one is worth a look

i love this movi i total disagre with some negat critiqu that i ve read over the year this wa a great vehicl for eddi murphi he appear to have a great time with his part a chandler jarrel and he should never care about what the critic say if he had fun do it and most of his audienc enjoy it and it wa fun to watch a it combin some great fantasi tension with mr murphi s great comed style you have to keep in mind that golden child is a fantasi film just an imagin work of magic and wonder amidst the real world dure the time this film wa releas i wa work in a video rental store this wa one of the most popular with all our custom everi singl time we put this one up on our monitor all the copi we had went out fast with wait list request that kept it on the queue for month everyon who rent it love it i wa the resid film critic and all my regular custom would ask my opinion befor they rent this wa one of my favorit and i knew the tast of my custom so i high recommend this one to most of them i realli feel that this film is a sleeper it may not have done too well at the box offic due to veri poor market but it hit a high in the video rental and purchas market later yes i did buy this film for my own video librari i ador the littl boy who play the golden child j l reat but after look at his profil in imdb i notic that he never did ani more film that is sad becaus he definit had an on screen aura and could have continu with a film career i also ador victor wong who play the old man i love him in his part a egg shen in big troubl in littl china at ani rate this wa a great film the onli drawback that didn t seem to fit with the theme were some of the part that got a bit more adult in natur such a chandler s rather sexual remark about the serpent ladi that wa present to him a a silhouett it wa funni but it still wa out of sync ok so there were a few suggest gratuit scene those were put in for the mind set of the day perhap this wa still an adventur and escapist type of film which we do need today to get away from all the hard core realiti and depress fluff that we are hit with from hollywood now that s entertain 
 
 
 
ok so i don t watch too mani horror movi and the reason is film like dark remain i caught this on a surpris featur fill dvd and it scare me silli in fact the onli extra i think the dvd wa miss wa a pair of new pant howev the next day i wa tell someon about it when i realis i d onli realli seen about of it the rest of the time i d been watch the pizza on my coffe tabl nervous that my girlfriend would catch me if i actual cover my eye the few time i did brave watch the screen i jump so hard that i decid not to look up again the film make is solid and the charact situat wa realli compel the simplic of the film is what realli captur my jump button it s mere a woodland a cabin and a disus jail and a lot of dark most surpris to me wa the fact that while this wa clear not a multi million dollar product the make up effect realli look like it wa also it s obvious this is a film made by someon with a great love of film make the sound design and the music realli made use of my surround system like mani hollywood movi have never done i notic on line that this film won the la shriekfest a realli major achiev and i guess that the festiv had seen the filmmak clear talent and probabl a great deal more of this movi than i manag to turn up the sound turn off the light and if you want to keep your girlfriend order a pizza 
 
 
 
i read noth but good thing about this movi and final had a chanc to watch it late last night and it wa everyth i expect it to be and more this is the way a proper horror movi should be i think the reason it wa so scari wa becaus it wa so realist the spooki sound score wa perfect for set a dark mood i like the dramat open scene and enjoy how the rest of the movi play out it wa veri easi to follow and understand unlik some movi which are way too complic the special effect were veri good i would love to see more horror movi like this one this is easili one of my favorit s a realist thunder and lightn storm would have set a nice atmospher for this movi other then that it had all the element a good horror movi need i high recommend this movi to anyon who can appreci a good scari movi that pull no punch i will be ad it to my collect the dvd ha some interest special featur 
 
 
 
although i wa in this movi play the part of sheriff hodg it still manag to make me jump in sever place and believ me i m not that easi you might say that i m bias about the film and ok i am but i didn t see the finish product until and wa extrem plea i m not a horror film fan a such but love the old b movi and black and white sci fi film this movi will make you think you know when someth is go to happen then it doesn t then it doe it will keep you complet off balanc i would suggest watch the movi first then the director s note and special featur it is so well written direct and film and i can tell you person that it wa a real joy to work with this cast and crew i sincer hope to be part of brian and laurenc s futur project 
 
 
 
i just watch this movi and have to say i wa veri impress it s veri creepi and ha numer moment that will make you jump out of seat i had to smoke sever emerg cigarett along the way to calm my nerv if i had to criticis i d say that perhap if anyth there were too mani jump moment it got to the point where everi singl new scene climax with a jump and this gradual wore away the startl effect becaus you kind of new what wa come although it contain virtual everi clich in the ghost genr they were all done so well that it maintain the creepi fear factor it had element of the shine the th sen and the changel in particular the soundtrack remind me of the changel i would high recommend this to anyon look for a good old fashion scare 
 
 
 
well this film is a difficult one realli to be straight with you this film doesn t contain much of a rivet stori nore doe it make u want to know how it ll end but i ll tell you someth now never have i been a ten and jump up befor in my life this film sure doe deliv the jump and thrill to be fair i did watch it at almost midnight so i wa kinda sleepi anyway so mayb that explain whi i wa jumpi or mayb it s becaus this film doe deliv in that aspect it s basic about a coupl who lose their child in a tragic event they decid to move away and rent a cabin look thing in the mountain all look peac and calm until they have their first visitor i think it s it s the sister of the main charact and she bring along her husband dure the night the husband hear nois check it out and that when thing start to go realli realli wrong they don t stay for anoth day and tell the coupl they should leav asap a someth isn t right to cut a long stori short eventu they find out what ha happen in that hous in the past few year and decid it need to be taken care of it s not a hollywood blockbust nore doe it have a huge budget but plea don t let that put you off it s creepi ten and veri veri jumpi just give it a tri 
 
 
 
dark remain is a home run plain and simpl the film is full of creepi visual and scare that will make the most season horror veteran jump straight out of there seat the staircas scene in particular these guy are good although they weren t work on a huge budget everyth look good and the actor come through dark remain doe have one of those interpret end which may be a negat for some but i guess it make you think cheri christian and greg thompson are spot on a the griev coupl tri to rebuild there live howev some side charact like the sheriff didn t convinc me they aren t all that import anyway i give dark remain a perfect ten rate for be ten time scarier than ani recent studio ghost stori japanes remak 
 
 
 
 the golden child wa eddi murphi s first film sinc his megahit bever hill cop and even though it s not a good a cop it s a fun comic adventur murphi star a a finder of lost child who s assign a most unusu case his assign to find the titl charact a child with mystic power this movi could have been titl bever hill cop and the templ of doom sinc part of this movi play like a spielbergian adventur kinda like an indiana jone comedi it s got comedi with laugh and adventur with special effect lot of fun out of four 
 
 
 
what s good about it some invent and genuin creepi littl effect that will get under the skin of even the most season horror fan doesn t reli on the hackney soundtrack stab for it gotcha moment even if you ve seen everyth there s still a few thing in this film that will make your jaw drop what could have been better about it the act wa at time flat and unconvinc it had a shot on video qualiti in some place though it most achiev the atmospher it wa strive for and the camera work is full of needle close up of meaningless action though the effect are genuin creepi i think they may have gone to the well a few too mani time with some of them the end seem rush and gloss over what could have been more impact moment the viewer is left to figur out a lot of thing for themselv not a a challeng by the filmmak but becaus they just miss it still a good littl indi horror film that is easili sever step abov the averag well worth the rental

i realli like this film all three star conneri fishburn and underwood give credibl perform and harri is enjoy over the top the light and shot angl in some of harri scene make his face look truli diabol the surpris turn of plot at the end make it interest not a great movi but an enjoy one i gave it of 
 
 
 
a young and seem promis colleg graduat play by blair underwood is sent to jail for the murder of an innoc young girl and is put on death row sean conneri play the happi go lucki attorney whom the young man s grandmoth track down out of retir and plead with to take on the case in the hope of free her grandson laurenc fishburn play a polic offic who wa well involv in the case and is hell bent on debunk an theori that conneri might dig up to tri and free the boy whom he and the entir polic depart swear is guilti of the crime ed harri kate capshaw rubi dee and the late lynn thigpen co star in this veri intens dramat thriller 
 
 
 
just caus is a flaw but decent film held togeth by strong perform and some creativ though exceed predict write sean conneri is an anti death penalti crusad brought in to save a seem innoc young black man blair underwood from the ultim penalti to set thing right conneri ventur to the scene of the crime where he must contend not onli with the passag of time but a meddl sheriff laurenc fishbourn twist and turn and role revers abound some surpris some not a the age crusad attempt to unravel the mysteri the climact end is a bit ludicr but just caus is worth a look on a slow night

i found this movi to be charm i thought the charact were develop sinc a i watch i found myself care about these peopl this is a period piec that i believ took place dure the depress a singl mother who is known a the town reclus she ha reason to be put an ad in the paper for a husband christoph reev play a ex con who happen into town look for work he see the ad and he goe out to see her she hire him i realli had some chuckl a their relationship progress becaus i found it easi to put myself in their shoe everyth went on so matter of fact he need the work so he doesn t want to upset her and she need his help but doesn t want him to get the upper hand they danc around the fact that they begin to realli need each other thing start warm up until the big blowup i won t spoil it by tell you what happen but the point of resolut is perfect wonder i found the stori to be veri believ for the time it s take place i think this is one of the better relationship stori out there mayb the younger generat won t get it but if you are over i think you ll like it and if you like christoph reev in somewher in time you ll like him in this one also 
 
 
 
i love this film the noir imageri combin with spillan s no nonsens charact mike hammer work marvel to creat a mood and feel seldom found in low budget detect film of the earli fifti it may not be the maltes falcon but this film make it s own solid contribut to the genr spillan is often criticis for alleg misogyni etc but his dame are way abov their male counterpart in term of cun and intellig poor old mike hammer a effect play by biff elliott is blind by the beauti of the mysteri psychiatrist whom he meet when investig the death of an armi buddi when the penni final drop his face is a pictur good to see that s censorship did not forc the film maker to omit the famous last line a bona fide low budget classic 
 
 
 
i consid this film to be the best one about mike hammer with biff elliott s perform the definit mike hammer harri essex s script is excel and contain mani improv on mickey spillan s novel his direct is strong and imagin and he make fine use of light and shadow the camera work by john alton is top notch a is the score by franz waxman the cast includ mani veteran player a well a peggi castl in her memor perform a charlott man all in all this is one of the finest privat eye film ever made biff elliott and haari essex should have receiv more opportun i have alway treasur this film 
 
 
 
 the last big thing is a wonder satir film that sardon whip pop cultur to the point of humor self desctruct the charact are so interest and fun to laugh at sympath with which bring me to an introduct to the charact i like best simon geist is a man in his late s earli s who creat a pop cultur driven editori magazin call the next big thing thing is this magazin doesnt realli exist and it is onli an excus for simon to get close to actor by interview them onli to bitch slap them silli insult their way of buy into pop cultur his live in femal friend darla is also write a magazin which is real which main ha to do with her and simon a well a her and her father darla is a genuin loveabl or loathabl charact depend on how you view her mute neurot behavior magda is a prostitut the charact i like the best brent is a flat charact with not much to him a is tedra the music video queen for a bunch of b rate rock band still these charact weav a veri interest web togeth and this movi question all the motiv that peopl have for what they do and whi they do it it a wonder film and i suggest you see it if you re in the indi art hous crowd mark my word 
 
 
 
this film is a good a it is difficult to find the film s hero and writer and director is simon geist a man with an agenda he creat a fake magazin just to have the author to interview the swine of los angel the actor the model the musician who believ that their own defec doesn t smell with clever dialog zucov succeed in do this sure the budget for this film wa probabl what he paid for a use car but this film is so solid and so well written that it work veri well ani person who can reenact edward munk s the scream in the reflect of a silver trashbin at a local coffe hous should be nomin for some type of award give this film a chanc and listen to what it say becaus they have been make the same car sinc it s call the car bravo zucov bravo

the interest aspect of the apprentic is it demonstr that the tradit job interview and resum do not necessarili predict teamwork skill task dedic and job perform and they certain don t reveal ani hidden agenda in other word a good indic of potenti may be to see a job applic in action which is the point of the apprentic peopl vy for a corpor posit may hand over a sugar coat resum and put on their best person attir for the interview but these are not necessarili the best indic of strength weak and perform briefli the apprentic involv job candid compet for the ultim career opportun a posit in real estat magnat donald trump s invest compani the apprentic refer to the winner who will win a salari posit learn the art of high stake deal make from the master himself and presum gain prime corpor connect the posit is a dream come true for those want to make more money than the gnp of some foreign countri to entic the candid trump show off his privat jet his privat luxuri apart replet with statu and artwork his limo his connect to celebr and other aspect of the life of a billionair magnat the road to success is not easi the group is divid into two team that compet against each other each ha a corpor sound name such a versacorp and prot g corpor the team are assign task that entail an entrepreneuri ventur such a creat advertis sell merchandis or negoti team select a project manag who provid the leadership and organiz skill to complet the task if they win the manag receiv a lot of credit particular in the eye of the final arbit if they lose the manag may also becom the scape goat some of the task are monument difficult with onli a day or two to complet task may involv creat a tv commerci or print ad other may involv sell at a retail outlet or on the street the task bring out the best and worst in the particip they often show immedi who is the most reliabl who is the most trustworthi and who is hard work and the task also expo who is not a good team player who is ineffici and who seem onli out for themselv the task invari reveal in unexpect way the strength and weak of the particip and in particular the project manag how well the manag communic with the team deleg work organ time and set specif goal will larg determin the outcom but it doe not necessarili predict the winner the singl most tell aspect of someon s potenti is when he or she is assign a a project manag their real abil a oppos to their self propag abil immedi show through the veneer that cannot be hidden by a silk tie or a beauti makeov leadership qualiti and or weak often becom agon obvious after onli a few minut those promot themselv a top notch leader are not alway a strong when put into a real life leadership situat it is alway easier to toot your own horn than to actual engag in leadership project manag even those on the win team often do not formul a cohes strategi they often believ that by dive off the deep end to complet the task at the first minut rather than take a littl time to organ and discus how the task will be complet is more effici more often than not member of an ill strateg team are run around like headless chicken figur it out a they go along and in the long run they end up wast far more time the win team get a tast of the high life such a eat dinner at an exclus restaur fli in a privat jet and or meet a celebr the lose team come to the dread board room where trump hear the lame excus of the member and knock off one or more of the contest like piec off a chess board with the now infam you re fire often the project manag is held partial respons for the team s loss and may be the target of trump s accusatori rhetor everi week at least one person becom a casualti from the lose team my least favorit aspect of the apprentic is the board room while the task themselv bring out the strength and weak in the candid the board room often bring out the worst unfortun the rule of the game insist there is one win team and one lose team even if the competit wa close member of the lose team start accus each other often ruthless about who wa at fault and sometim more than one person get fire i seldom see an under perform candid take respons for their action in the board room kristi frank and kwame jackson were possibl the onli candid who took full respons for her team s loss and receiv no recognit for this selfless act for me kristi frank and kwame jackson had the most integr of all the candid howev trump saw kristi a weak and fire her claim she wasn t stand up for herself which may mean he valu ego more than integr no one should sacrific their integr for this kristi frank may not have becom the apprentic but she can live with herself know she did not blame other unjust isn t that worth a much a win the strength of the apprentic is also it weak becaus team perform is evalu strict by winner and loser other evalu opportun are overlook bar huge gap between the win and lose team sometim a lose team exemplifi a high standard of teamwork and effici i have seen lose team sometim appear better organ than the win team we american are so often ob with win and lose that we often overlook excel 
 
 
 
i start watch the apprentic about year ago mayb and i realli realli like it the first thing that strike you about it is the refresh format which though similar to a lot of other realiti show at it core is still veri entertain donald trump is wonder a the host and the main judg of the show a well the cast coup with intellig peopl have good look be pick a contest is appreci a well but the best part of the show is new york citi mark burnett may have made a lot of crap in his time but his handl of the cinematographi is excel a he make nyc look like a charact unto itself the jazz tune coupl with some great camera work make new york look spectacular the apprentic will easili alway make my top realiti show of all time the amaz race is no howev but just like the amaz race this show is alway best watch in moder if you keep watch it for a while the origin of the show will wear off fast the same case a with tar star world the broadcast in this countri did a bang up job in present the show the first three season were shown in a row then after year the next two season were shown which kept the concept fresh in conclus you will love this show especi the first season howev if you keep watch the show continu thereaft it charm will wear off and fast

the origin titl mean the birth of the octopus i must confess that i do not quit understand this titl the english titl is water lili but after have written this i read the comment by anoth user the titl in french is also suggest prieuv or octopus suggest an individu have to juggl mani pressur simultan thank for your explan the basic theme is the first sexual emot of girl when it is not clear if they are direct toward the same or the other sex it is no differ for boy i think that both florian and mari will eventu have heterosexu feel without ani admixtur much of the movi is water ballet sometim the girl will have their head downward and noth abov the water except their foot and lower leg with which they will wave and kick in the air to peopl like me who had never seen such thing befor it wa fascin florian is the leader of one team of water lili mari tell her that she would like to see when florian is train this seem to be their first contact that is not just ordinari soon they will walk togeth florian take mari to a garag where a boy is wait for her and then goe away with him for an hour while mari is wait for her to return i took for grant that the coupl slept with each other but we will later learn from the movi that they do le than that i can suppli some inform which few user will find elsewher there is a scene in which mari secret steal florian s garbag bag in it she find an appl most eaten and mari proceed to eat the rest there is a parallel scene in anoth movi kazetachi no gogo afternoon breez by hitoshi yazaki japan this is about adult young femal and a clear lesbian woman is vain in love with a heterosexu woman she also steal a garbag bag of the belov and also find a more or le eaten appl and eat the rest later florian tell mari that she would like to have her first orgasm from her mari say she cannot do this but still later mari say that she is inde will to do it and she masturb on florian there is no nuditi in this scene probabl onli a femal director could have made such a fine psycholog show or studi of i would like to quot baudelair le amour enfantin florian is play by ad le haenel who made the excel perform a the autist girl in the littl devil by christoph ruggia a veri underr movi

 shore leav is most an averag star trek adventur noth wrong with the episod though i simpli think that this is not the best represent of what the show had to offer to fan it is lightweight entertain noth more howev i m glad to see that a tv show of this type had enough good sen to take a break from serious intergalact conflict in this episod kirk decid to grant his crew some time off and a land parti is beam down to a planet that look like the perfect place for a vacat a usual the planet is not a peac a it appear to be there are some action and ten moment but most of the stori is play for laugh good but unexcept 
 
 
 
anoth episod from childhood that a an adult i look back on with a differ perspect this wa one of my favorit childhood episod one that realli cement my ador of this show howev on view this episod after year i d say it is definit one of the lighter one play for laugh and amus instead of the dramat and well construct stori line in previous episod in this their first and best season perhap this episod wa written for a littl fan r r too a mr spock would say the stori just isn t logic but there are some amus line like of cours mr spock s final one at the end when he ask the captain mccoy et al whether they enjoy their r r and they answer in the affirm he rais an eyebrow and say fascin in onli the way mr spock could do that an interest stori line of cours the idea of an amus park be actual amus instead of the fake and often annoy amus of disneyland for exampl be abl to have one s wish actual come true realli a great idea but not that well execut and come from theodor sturgeon anoth of the great sf short stori writer they use in the first season one wonder how much tinker wa done to the script that sturgeon turn in now here is a littl trivia i learn on this veri site in jame gunn establish the theodor sturgeon award for best short scienc fiction stori and i ll quot the rest from this site in he sturgeon wrote the joy machin a third script for the star trek tv seri amok time the other that wa never shot the main reason that it wasn t use in the seri is that it contain expens special effect sequenc that would be too much for their budget howev the script wa adapt into a book by sci fi writer jame gunn star trek the origin seri and publish by pocket book in i d sum this up to say this episod is still veri enjoy especi if one doesn t think too much about it just laugh and enjoy it and next episod we can get back to the serious stuff of protect the univers 
 
 
 
this is one of the shallowest episod in that the plot realli seem like an excus to just have fun but i appreci this light heart approach and this is truli one of the best episod to see on a pure fun level think about it the crew member have encount with the white rabbit and alic from wonderland a bengal tiger a samurai warrior a knight on horseback who kill mccoy and a host of other seem bizarr event that just don t make ani sen at all until the veri end despit all the danger you just can t take everyth veri serious it s just too fun and the whole episod seem veri surreal so on a pure non aesthet level it s great stuff 
 
 
 
first of all riget is wonder good comedi and mysteri thriller at the same time nice combin of strang dogma style of tell the stori togeth with good music and great actor but unfortun there s no the end a for me it s unaccept i wa think how it will be possibl to continu the stori without helmer and druss and i have some idea i think lar should make riget iii a littl bit differ i m sure that rd part without helmer wouldn t be the same so here s my suggest maybl littl bit stupid mayb not i know that lar like to experi so whi not to make small experi with riget i think the onli solut here is to creat puppet driven anim like for exampl team america by trey parker or even comput d anim i know it s not the same a real actor but in principl i believ it could work onli this way it s possibl to make actor aliv again for riget fan this shouldn t be so big differ if the anim will be done in good way averag watcher will consid it normal just after first few shot of the movi the most import thing now is the stori it s complet understand that it s not possibl to creat riget with the actor nowaday so whi not to play with anim and look for the possibl that it give to you even market one great director finish his trilog after year use puppet anim just dream i hope to see riget someday or even to see just the script i m curious how the stori end and a i expect everybodi here do greet slaj p i m not talk about the kingdom hospit by stephen king 
 
 
 
the product qualiti cast premis authent new england waterburi ct local and lush john william score should have result in a star collector item unfortun all we got wa a passabl star decent flick most memor for what it tri to do bring an art hous style film mainstream the small town local and stori of ordinari peopl is a genr to itself and if well done will satisfi most grownup jane fonda wa unabl to hide her braini enough to make her charact believ i wonder whi she wasn t do a post doctor at yale instead of work in a dead end factori job in waterburi robert diniro s charact wa just a bit too contriv an illiter nice guy loser who turn out to actual be with a littl help from jane s charact a version of henri ford or thoma edison this genr ha been more success handl by nobodi s fool in the mid s and this year s about schmidt i wish that the main stream studio would tri more stuff for post adolesc and reserv a coupl of screen at the multi cinema complex for those effort i ll give it an a for effort 
 
 
 
bogmeist and other have pretti much nail this shore leav is realli tos first attempt at lightweight sci fi which they would later perfect with the classic troubl with tribbl it gave both the crew of the enterpris and it tv viewer a need respit from the univers threaten consequ of for exampl the corbomit manouev look for a place to chill out for a while the enterpris happen across a seem idyl m class planet and send an exploratori team down to take a closer look soon enough all kind of absurd begin to take place some seem peril but it all seem a morass of human emot extrem play out in a weird blend of fantast mysteri mccoy ha gone through the look glass psycholog thriller kirk is stalk by an indefatig bulli from his past and romant comedi no comment tos wa the least serial of all of the seri in the trek franchis so it is easi to forget how mani episod in the first season focus on heavi hand potenti calamit drama unlik later seri franchis writer tos product team wa not afraid to liter go where no tv seri had gone befor and shore leav despit it occasion problem is an exampl my onli critic of this episod is that the cast particular shatner iron given his legendari sen of humor didn t seem to know how to handl this new wrinkl on st s theme the last scene is possibl one of the worst scene i can rememb from the entir tos run both composit and in term of act nuff said my recommend see it while watch the entir first season a it wa meant to be seen it order 
 
 
 
paul verhoeven genius and master film maker strike back with the le than perfect yet still fun in a dirti old man type of way hollow man the first two act are so good that the slasher final act disappoint yet i am give a recommend to this film for it s mind blow special effect perhap the best so far around and two dandi perform by the lead verhoeven s moral question are of cours thought provok and although the film turn off mani this movi is pretti soft core for old verhoeven two major flaw josh brolin aka walk ape man and the whole deal with the elev if there wa an access ladder whi were they trap down in the lab a fun horror film for a saturday night 
 
 
 
hollow man start a brilliant but flaw scientist dr sebastian cain kevin bacon final work out how to make thing visibl again after have been turn invis by his own serum they test the serum on an alreadi invis gorilla it work perfect cain his team of assist s celebr but while he should report the breakthrough to his militari backer cain want to be the first invis human he manag to persuad his team to help him the procedur work well cain becom invis howev when they tri to bring him back the serum fail he remain invis the team desper search for an antidot but noth work cain slowli start to lose his grip on realiti a he realis what power he ha but is unabl to use it be trap in a laboratori but then again he s invis right he can do anyth he want direct by paul verhoeven i rather like hollow man you know it s just after christma i saw this a few hour ago on late night earli morn cabl tv worst of all i feel sick not becaus of the film but becaus of the chocol fizzi pop i ve had over the past week so i ll keep this one brief the script by andrew w marlow ha a decent pace about but it doe drag a littl dure the middl ha a good central premis it take he basic idea that be invis will make you insan just like in the origin the invis man film which hollow man obvious owe a fair bit it manag to have a petti success blend of horror sci fi action provid good entertain valu for odd minut i thought the charact s were ok i thought some of the idea in the film were good although i think it s general known that verhoeven doesn t deal in subtleti the first thing he ha the invis cain do is sexual molest one of his team then when he get into the outsid world he ha cain rape a woman with the justif who s go to know that cain say to himself then of cours there s the gore he show a rat be torn apart that s just the open scene after the credit to be fair to him the violenc is a bit more spar this time around but still ha a quit nasti sadist tone about it have said that i love horror gore exploit film so hollow man deliv for me it s just that it might not be everyon s cup of tea director verhoeven doe a great job or should that be the special effect boy make him look good the special effect in hollow man realli are spectacular more or le flawless their brilliant it s a simpl straight forward a that there s some good horror action set piec here a well even if the climat fight is a littl over the top i love the effect where kevin bacon disappear one layer at a time complet with vein organ bone on full show or when the revers happen with the gorilla there s a few gori moment includ a rat be eaten someon is impal on a spike someon ha their head bust open with blood splatter result with a stagger budget of about hollow man is technic faultless i can imagin the interview on the dvd where some special effect boffin say they map bacon s entir bodi out right down to he last vein which they actual did becaus you know everyon watch would notic if one of his vein were miss or in the wrong posit wouldn t they the act wa ok bacon made for a good mad scientist anti hero type guy hollow man is one of hose big budget hollwood extravaganza where the effect action take center stage over ani sort of meaning stori or charact s but to be brutal honest sometim we all like that in a film well i know i do good solid big budget entertain with a slight nastier darker streak than the usual hollywood product definit worth a watch 
 
 
 
it seem a lot of imdb comment on this film are bias in the sen that they tri to compar it to an older version true hollow man is a remak of sort of the invis man but that s where the similar end hollow man is an entertain movi period if you watch a movi with the intent of find a mani flaw a possibl then you shouldn t watch movi in the first place true some movi are plain horrend and unbear but hollow man manag to entertain and make you think what you would do if you were invis and if you had your ex get laid with one of your friend kevin bacon star a a eccentr scientist who along with a team of collabor discov the way to make anim invis now his mission is to make them visibl again when this team of young scientist work a you might guess for the pentagon think they have the formula for make anim visibl again kevin bacon volunt to be the first to tri the new experiment drug after that of cours thing go wrong a kevin bacon remain invis for the rest of the movi and is oblig to wear a latex mask so his collabor know where he is feel of paranoia and desper begin to take over kevin s charact and when he find out that his ex girlfriend and collabor elisabeth shue is have a torrid affair with anoth of the young scientist in the team he final snap the movi then turn into a hybrid of alien and a slasher flick but that s not say it s a bad turn there are scare and chill and the movi move at a nice pace the special effect are top notch a qualiti alway preval in all of paul verhoeven s film a we get to see some bodi reconstitut sequenc never seen on a movi befor if there s anyth to complain about perhap is the predict of the situat herein by the first hour of the movi you know kevin bacon will make the jump from be weird and eccentr to be a homicid lunat in the end and the end is a bit abrupt but despit this hollow man is still worth watch if you want to know what a truli bad movi is then wast your money on fear dot com with stephen dorf or the even wors the untold or sasquatsh with land henriksen now that is hollow out of

the spoiler warn is for those peopl who want to see for themselv what anim and landscap pas befor their eye although i don t mention it in great detail earth is an approx minut cinema version base on planet earth which i watch all on bbc tv the tv version wa narrat by david attenborough a captiv comment who i had wish had also done it for earth but it is patrick stewart star trek s captain picard there are regular shot of the earth from space so that s may be appropri in ani case he ha a nice enough and calm voic for it there are chapter in which we follow anim life on earth from north pole to antarctica anim famili polar bear eleph and whale appear in more than one of these part each chapter start with an indic how far from north pole or equat it is we see someth of each kind of anim but onli mammal and bird and some fish and some beauti shot of veget mountain waterfal desert and jungl a near perfect present of the varieti of life and landscap and climat on earth you get the impress that our planet is onli inhabit by anim peopl or villag or citi aren t in the film so it s a typic natur documentari but breathtak shot and accompani by delight music when the film open i alreadi knew it would end far too soon for me it is a famili film so no brutal kill of ani anim when one is caught by his hunter the shot end and in other case where we see the prey be caught it s shot in slow motion which make it le violent and watchabl for young child age limit in the netherland no blood is shed some scene newli born anim are realli cute and will be ador by kid it look like an ordinari natur film but when you know how mani shoot day it took and how much money it ha cost it becom an even more astonish piec of beauti it had it s dutch premier yesterday a month befor the actual releas in a cinema of seat of which were taken true beauti is rare interest for cinema goer it seem a i knew the tv seri i wa of cours veri curious if my favourit scene would make it into this movi some didn t but the most impress shot big waterfal did luckili it wa the first time i ever cri in a natur film 
 
 
 
you have to see it to believ it director alastair fothergil and mark linfield have done a thing realli great it is a out of so i can not believ that other user of this web had rate it so poor unless they were expect to see just a normal movi with peopl love scene and so on i am also convinc that this kind of documentari are an excel way to wake up u in order to save our beauti planet final it ha noth to do with al gore s documentari movi an inconveni truth main made of long monologu pain and with truth not alway accur a mani scientist have point alreadi the best thing you can do on earth is not miss earth 
 
 
 
there is some spectacular heart stop beauti photographi here of a rang of sceneri and anim from arctic to tropic and everyth in between the camera techniqu are vari and spot on from close up to aerial work edit is tremend and the commentari is spot on too with just the right tone and some dramat and tell fact about our world where the film fall down a bit is in tri to cover and integr four theme season pattern climat chang individu anim stori and hunter hunt interact across multipl environ eventu it all get a bit bitti and disjoint overal well worth see especi given the issu cover but don t expect oscar materi 
 
 
 
this is simpli the most astonish movi you will ever see i thought it wa just anoth documentari but it realli is someth el it doesn t tri to teach you anyth it show you how life work in natur i won t talk about the qualiti of the pictur becaus you obvious know from other comment it is unmatch earth is funni ten and sad it can make you laugh it can make you cri sometim both at the same time this is the first movi that made me cri not becaus you feel sorri for the anim but becaus you come to realis how fragil our planet is and what treasur we were bless with yet we don t appreci it one bit this movi should be shown obligatori in school it is the most wonder film you will ever see so go and see it who know mayb it is the last time we might see our planet like this but i would easili rate it more if it were possibl 
 
 
 
i wa realli look forward too see this movi a it ha been advertis a a must see movi for peopl that love movi about natur the movi show differ climat and the anim associ with them by start at the north pole and go down south a the movi progress the footag from this movi is often breathtak beauti and i mani time wonder how on earth they could have taken some of the shot under water or in the sky howev beauti a larg part of the footag i had alreadi seen in the tv seri planet earth narrat by david attenborough i found attenborough s narrat of planet earth to be much better than the narrat of earth earth is an easier movi it skip much of the scientif detail that attenborough cover in his planet earth seri for instanc earth will tell you that a tropic sea is an ideal nurseri for a young humpback whale becaus there are few predat planet earth will tell you that a tropic sea is a good nurseri becaus the water is low in oxygen and doesn t contain enough nutrient to support veri larg anim like larg shark etc to me that s an import differ that togeth with attanborough s far superior voic make planet earth a far better documentari than earth still howev i think earth is worth watch for the beauti footag and the fact that it s easier to understand make it interest for child too 
 
 
 
kept my attent from start to finish great perform ad to this tremend film mr pacino onc again give u anoth brilliant charact to enjoy 
 
 
 
we often see movi about undesir thing go on in polit but i still recommend citi hall in a role he wa born to play al pacino star a new york s mayor who ha to deal with the shoot of a boy but it turn out that noth that he doe will realli have ani effect in this movi the charact are a gritti a we would expect of anyon involv in a polit scandal no matter how much you trust ani given politician you may have your doubt after watch this movi i understand that i can t name ani specif exampl of someth similar to what this movi portray but that s not the point if we had idealist impress of those at the top this movi tear such idea down certain one that i encourag you to see also star john cusack bridget fonda danni aiello anthoni franciosa and david paymer 
 
 
 
in a perform both volatil and grace al pacino re team with sea of love director harold becker a new york mayor john pappa in citi hall a savvi thriller that the first film ever shot insid the lower manhattan structur that s ground zero for the citi s govern that the other nyc locat provid the vivid set a an idealist mayor aid john cusack follow a trail of subvers and cover up that may loop back to the man he serv and rever bridget fonda danni aiello martin landau toni franciosa and david paymer add more starri brillianc to this grip tale of power and the power behind power 
 
 
 
citi hall take on the polit of a citi rather than countri state or ani sort of major polit tabl grant it shine on new york citi which is a huge polit arena especi nowaday but it still goe for a smaller scale and put the microscop on a few key player in a citi wide scandal stumbl on by the mayor s right hand director harold becker is a director veri familiar with element of the thriller have done mercuri rise malic and domest disturb and i think in mani way he incorpor so mani of the formula thriller genr that it almost to a fault i mean citi hall is meant to be a polit drama not a thriller but instead when all is said and done and onc you get to the meat and potato of the film it feel and look like a thriller but a decent one at that with veri import part of the recip that immedi make it stand out what el or rather who el al pacino the film begin by give you a realli good look at life in the mayor offic and the inner work of the citi a the film continu it broaden it polit spectrum to includ a democrat bos and his connect and then we are introduc to some of the go on within the citi a event unfold a mysteri begin and the polit aspect is kind of left in the background but it still ha a brilliant set up i absolut hate talk about al pacino i mean even if onc he didn t give a good perform how could i ever say it the man is act royalti there is just someth brilliant about his entir demeanor in citi hall pacino play the new york citi mayor he ha a sen of duti and honor and immedi appear to be a veri upstand politician he also deliv one of the most power and outright engag speech i ve ever seen at the jame bone funer i re watch that speech four time and the first time i watch pacino give it my mouth gape open and i almost want to stand up and applaud it brilliant written and brilliant deliv by pacino john cusack who i realli do enjoy a an actor turn in a mediocr and overdon perform a the deputi mayor kevin calhoun he is kind of the focus of the film and him and pacino have good chemistri togeth when they are on screen but there is just someth in this perform he seem like he s tri too hard his accent is just bizarr and although he is suppos to be cutthroat and intimid he doesn t get seem to pull it off mayb he wa have an off film bridget fonda on her way out of her high point stardom doe an okay job a attorney for polic widow marybeth cogan her perform is veri similar to cusack s in that she just doesn t seem to find her groov with this charact danni aiello is terrif although his charact is a littl under explor a democrat bos with tie to the mafia frank anselmo martin landau make a decent cameo a judg under scrutini walter stern the problem with citi hall is evid in my review of the charact and actor everyon is okay there is a lot of back stori that they tri to bring out without actual show it and it unfortun leav you just a littl bit confus about the whole conspiraci and of cours you have al pacino in a rather small support role but he s absolut brilliant at it and outshin and overshadow everi other actor in the film it almost feel like mayb they are intimid by him be on screen with them so citi hall could have been this huge polit epic drama thriller but it felt cut and tone down to an averag run of the mill one but it still ha to be seen for pacino and a differ spin on the inner work of polit if you just won t see this movi than find pacino s speech at jame bone funer becaus the word electrifi doesn t seem to give it justic but you can see what make al pacino so incred becaus in a mediocr film he pull out this wallop of a speech and make you feel it if you re a john cusack fan which i am he s definit done better but he is the main charact and all in all he doe get his justic a decent movi but unfortun potenti loss

overal the film is ok i think it s better than sepet and much better than gubra in term of it stori it sentiment valu there are a few scene that make me touch yes i agre that the boy mukhsin did his act veri good brilliant i can say that his act is almost natur howev the song ne me quitt pa by nina simon realli menaikkan my bulu rom i love the song both the song ne me quitt pa and hujan i just download the song beauti and salut to yasmin the movi s end credit make me touch again we can see how yasmin realli appreci her parent in an uniqu way i think the movi deserv that grand prix of intern juri at berlin film festiv i give out of o star 
 
 
 
like his earlier film in a glass cage agust villaronga achiev an intens and high poetic canva that is even more refin visual than it predecessor this is one of the most visual accomplish and haunt pictur one could ever see the heighten drama intens and underton of violenc threaten on the the melodramat or farcic yet never step into it in that way it pull off an almost imposs feat to be so over the top and yet so pain restrain to be so charg and yet so underst and even the explos final are virtuos feast of the eye unabash gorgeous and high ten this film is simpli superb 
 
 
 
i thought that mukhsin ha been wonder written it not just about entertain there s tonn of subtl messag that i think yasmin wa tri to bring across and yes it might be confus to some of you especi if you didn t watch sepet and or gubra for time i bet u notic how they use charact from the two movi befor right it realli iron how the charact relat like the bossi neighbour is that prostitut from gubra and the chick at the snooker pad turn out to be the religi and wife of the pious man in the futur and i absolut love the voic over it crude yet awaken fresh like when they took a shot of the rumah tumpangan gamin signboard then there wa sudden mukhsin s voic say bismillahhirrahmannirrahim the scene when he climb the tree it captur malaysian s attitud and in some mild way snigger at how pathet it is portray in the charact for exampl even the kid can be realli sharp tongu complet with the shrill annoy voic and simpli bad mouth ppl all movi long and how you can be such a busybodi and talk about ppl when ur own life isn t sort out all i can say is this movi total reach my expect if not exceed it it kept me glu to the screen i couldn t even take my eye off it not even to make out in the cinema ha ha 
 
 
 
this film is a quit entertain horror antholog film along the line of tale from the crypt written by robert bloch author of psycho it s good fun for horror fan and ha an excel cast the movi should also be requir view for doctor who fan sinc jon pertwe the third doctor ha an amus role a a rude and obnoxi horror star 
 
 
 
this is a veri amus and sometim quit creepi antholog that if a bit short in the screenwrit depart more than make up for the shortcom in the act locat work and overal exuber the best episod of this are the first with denholm elliot play a horror writer stalk by a charact from his novel in the work a perfect exampl of the act pull this out of the mere pedestrian the third with christoph lee a a man terrifi of his own daughter and the final episod with the late great jon pertwe a a pompous horror film star who get more than just a new role on his latest project the dialogu between pertwe and ingrid pitt is sparkl and inspir both obvious relish the opportun to realli ham it up cush is typic good in the weakest segment which certain isn t help by the fact that the wax figur of the woman he s ob with down at the local wax museum is anyth but beauti a we are told to believ she is someon of shock beauti wa need and instead we re given a woman with a jaw of a turtl minor quibbl asid this movi and it s wonder countri hous set is one to catch when you can 
 
 
 
for fan of s hammer type horror film this movi should be a treat the onli thing i didn t like about the film wa the fact that peter cush wa wast on the worst episod in general howev this is a solid spooki littl movi if this is not amicus best film it s certain one of them the best episod right save for last is the one featur jon pertwe a a horror film actor it is realli excel a good a pertwe wa in this role it s hard to believ he didn t do more of these type of movi all in all this is an entertain movi which scare the heck out of me a a child and which still give me the creep to this day 
 
 
 
an excel movi and great exampl of how scari a movi can be without realli show the viewer anyth it s a set of four stori all revolv around the tenant of a charm old fashion hous and their various gruesom and horrif fate all tie togeth by a wrap around stori about a scotland yard inspector search for a miss horror film star it start out with a stori about a mysteri writer whose main charact becom a littl too realist follow by a stori about two old romant rival who becom ob over a wax figur in a museum then a stori about a sweet angel littl child who is anyth but and close with the stori of what happen to the miss film star and what he doe to the inspector it s a gorgeous print that let you realli appreci the work of director duffel and what he wa abl to accomplish with a veri small budget add to that the act talent of peter cush christoph lee denholm elliott joss ackland ingrid pitt and jon pertwe and you ve got a movi that can be enjoy again and again just don t answer the phone if anyon from stoker real estat call to offer you a bargain on a beauti hous in the english countrysid

this is an incred film i can t rememb the last time i saw a swedish movi this layer it s funni it s tragic it s compel and most of all it s a slice of swedish small town life it crush the clich s and dwell deeper it make you feel connect not onli to the main charact but to all the charact big citi girl trace back to her root her small hometown to celebr her father s th birthday cross path with peopl she hasn t met in sever year although the stori itself isn t uniqu it offer a fresh approach the center of the stori is the relationship between three sister on differ stage in life who aren t veri close or at least don t realiz how close they are one key reason that make it so easi to connect to the peopl in this film is the immacul cast first i m more than plea about the fact that there are absolut no so call a list swedish actor in this film usual there is a hand of actor that ha the abil to find their way into almost everi major product in sweden this time the product compani manag to keep it real by cast actor who actual seem to love their profess sofia helin is probabl the first swedish actress sinc eva r se to prove that you don t need word to convey an emot the write is also veri appeal the dialogu is more than believ and compar with other swedish film from the past year or two it s ahead by mile maria blom control everyth from the begin and if you didn t know you would never guess that this is her first time write and direct a featur length film i can t wait for her next one onc you start watch this you realli want to see it through

smallvill episod justic is the best episod of smallvill it s my favorit episod of smallvill 
 
 
 
this particular episod of smallvill is probabl the best episod to air sinc reunion this is for mani reason for exampl it take the seri back to some of it s root it welcom back lionel from a suppos long absenc with the luthorcorp plaza offic in metropoli this room hasn t been in smallvill for a veri long time and see it again bring back mani memori from the smallvill s past not to mention lionel convers with lex are alway admir anoth pleasant return is well uv guess it is bart allen aka impuls ac aka aquaman and victor stone aka cyborg not onli doe steven deknight reunit the former justic leaguer he blend them in with the smallvill formula in such a uniqu way that it almost feel like it is a featur length movi from there you get the basic stori green arrow form the leagu attempt to blow up bart get captur clark save him and the facil is blown to kingdom com all is good and grace with a good mix of stealth action pace and suspens oh and cyborg ha some cool new upgrad true to the justic leagu charact the music is probabl what make this episod work so well if you rememb correct the first episod steven deknight direct wa agless from season this wa a mediocr episod but someth felt out of place mayb it wa the music or the act or the fact clark sai at the end we didn t find you you found u kind of made peopl lose faith in the formula but thank steve deknight redeem himself in this justic episod i had a few quivvl about justic that made it fall short of the full first of all the far too cheesi exit of the justic leagu from the ridg facil expols i mean it would have been soo much cooler if say green arrow and cyborg took off on oliv s bike rememeb from the arrow episod clark and impuls should have obvious ran and aquaman should have swam via anoth rout but that wa soo incred cheesi it nock off point from the full second anoth cheesi moment not a bad a the first but when green arrow sai let s go save the world that made me cring all in all judg by the act perform music direct and product valu the pro do outweigh the con and this is still one of the best episod in smallvill histori and mayb the nd best episod in season out of 
 
 
 
i realli enjoy this episod see the flash cyborg green arrow and aquaman even though all he did wa swim made my eye widen to see most of the founder of the justic leagu tri to bring down lex luthor is what i ve been wait for this sound a bit off topic but make a live action justic leagu show would definit make me have a reason to shove everyth that i usual do dure the week down the drain just to watch one episod this is the thrill i got from watch this episod i wish they had made this episod a littl longer like a two hour special becaus i felt that one hour of the justic leagu wasn t enough now befor i bore you unless i alreadi have with my rambl i just want to say smallvill is cool again it sort of lost it touch when the show start focus on lana but i m sure the writer will just fall back into that loop hole so enjoy this episod who know when anoth good one s go to come out catch it again this thursday feb if you miss the first air 
 
 
 
show favorit green arrow introduc this season aquaman introduc in season impuls season and cyborg season all come togeth along with clark to stop one of lex s evil plan in this thrill mid season episod through his sophist technolog green arrow learn that lex luthor is construct laboratori across the world that hold peopl induc by the meteor substanc kryptonit and peopl with abil to run test on green arrow over the past month ha alli arthur curri aqua bart allen impuls and victor stone cyborg to stop lex and destroy these facil after recruit clark to help the team put on quit a show in interrog and destroy a local laboratori this episod is incred full of action humor and fabul dialog it feel more like a movi it is full of entertain and provid a a springboard for the most interest storylin of the sixth season 
 
 
 
i love this episod it is so great that all of them team up and stop luthercorp and save the world i also love this episod becaus kyle gallner bart allen impuls and justin hartley oliv queen green arrow are guest star in it i just hope that clark will join the justic leagu and we ll get to follow this group of hero across the globe it wa realli excit and keep viewer interest becaus of what will happen next i think chloe should also join the team a watchtow that would be such a coool thing for her to do besid the daili planet becaus she doesn t have super power also i want to find out what type of subject lex is go to use for i wonder what other type of power other peopl in the world have

a someon el ha alreadi said here everi scene in this film is gem most film are lucki to have one scene that is perfect but director jewison hit a home run everi time the cast got just the right take on the excel script and in addit dick hyman s music set of the opera and the other music made for a perfect match hard to imagin how they kept the precis mood go throughout the long product of a film the comedi is subtl most and the camera work mirror everi littl emot inflect of the narrat cher is such a comedi natur vincent gardenia who i know most through his frank lorenzo role on all in the famili until i saw him in this and then off broadway in the s deserv far greater stardom than he ever got and aiello s hapless loser are just the tip of the iceberg when it come to give kudo to this tremend cast ha jewison ever written about this film would love to read it hard to figur out whi the averag rate here at imdb is so low

the case of the scorpion s tail is a high stylish giallo direct by sergio martino who appear to be a giallo master second onli to dario argento ernesto gastaldi wrote this fabul who dunnit quit complex but ultim veri satisfi and entertain murder mysteri it also make sen in the end a big plus caus that s not alway the case for these giallo s a they tend to stretch credibl with their endless red herring and ultim solut here the le you know about the plot the better pure giallo trademark present here are the beauti cinematographi the catchi music score the gorgeous femal anita strindberg is a goddess brutal murder black glove murder and explicit sex scene to name a few in most part it s decent act goerg hilton his usual suav self and other do fair well martino direct with a sure hand keep thing tight and atmospher with some terrif set piec if you re a giallo fan this is a must see if you like well written and suspens thriller in general this come high recommend 
 
 
 
a fine martino outing this is a spirit and enjoy giallo with fine perform from good look cast and princip the two lead georg hilton and anita strindberg for me the jig saw puzzl of a plot is so convolut and confus you just sit back and enjoy rather than tri to anticip just when all seem resolv we are again taken on a further seri of twist enjoy twist it ha to be said sexi with plenti of gori kill this a well pace movi with london athen and greek coastal locat a super final set upon aegean rock wrap thing up and much fun wa had by all 
 
 
 
sergio martino is a great director who ha contribut a lot to italian genr cinema and a far a i am consid his gialli from the s are the undisput highlight in his impress repertoir la coda dello scorpion aka the case of the scorpion s tale of is one of these impress film martino ha contribut to italian horror s most origin sub genr and anoth proof that the man is a master of atmospher style and suspens my person favorit of the martino film i ve seen so far is still the insan brilliant your vice is a lock room and onli i have the key of follow by torso and the strang vice of mr wardh all of which i person like even more than this one that s pure a matter of person tast howev a la coda dello scorpion is an equal excel film that is essenti for everi fan of italian horror cinema and suspens in general the film which deliv tantal suspens from the veri begin ha a complex and grip plot that begin with the mysteri demis of a millionair who ha die in a plane crash insur investig peter lynch georg hilton is assign to verifi the circumst the insur compani which is due to pay a larg sum to the deceas man s wife soon after lynch begin to investig a person is brutal kill which is just the begin of a seri of murder the case of the scorpion s tail excel deliv all the element a great giallo need the film is stun suspens from the begin the score by bruno nicolai is brilliant the plot is wonder convolut and the killer s ident remain a mysteri until the end regular giallo lead man georg hilton onc again deliv an excel perform in the lead sexi anita strindberg is absolut ravish in the femal lead the includ the great luigi pistilli one of the most brilliant regular of italian genr cinema of the s and s and alberto de mendoza anoth great actor who should be familiar to ani lover of italian cinema athen where most of the film take place is actual a great set for a giallo the atmospher is constant grip and the photographi great and bruno nicolai s ingeni score make the suspens even more intens long stori short la coda dello scorpion is anoth excel giallo from sergio martino and an absolut must see for ani lover of the sub genr stylish suspens and great in all regard 
 
 
 
i m realli tempt to reward the case of the scorpion s tail with a solid out of rate but that would larg be becaus i think italian horror cinema of the s is so much better than the cheesi crap i usual watch but even without an extra point for nostalgia this is still a genuin masterwork and earn a high rate for it excel convolut stori uncanni atmospher blood soak kill sequenc and superb cast choic in my humbl opinion this is actual sergio martino s finest giallo and that ha got to mean someth a the strang vice of mr wardh all the color of the dark torso and your vice is a lock room and onli i have the key are all top notch genr achiev a well but this film is just a tad bit superior with it ultra compel plot revolv on an insur fraud gone mad out of control follow her husband s peculiar death in a plane explos lisa baumer prompt becom the suspici owner of one million dollar and she s eager to leav the countri a soon a possibl due to the bizarr circumst the insur compani put their best investig peter lynch on the case and he follow her to greec there lisa becom the target of mani assault and the case s mysteri increas when it turn out sever peopl are hunt for the money i m alway over anxious when briefli summar gialli becaus i don t want to risk give away essenti plot element in the case of the scorpion s tail the event take an abrupt and total unexpect turn befor the stori is even halfway and i certain don t want to ruin this for you mani red herring follow after that but sergio martino alway succeed to stay one step ahead of you and even though not a satisfi the denouement is at least surpris it s also a veri stylish film with imagin camera work and excel music by bruno nicolai everyon s favorit giallo muse edwig fenech odd didn t make it to this cast she star in no le than other suprem martino gialli but anita strindberg lizard in a woman s skin who saw her die is a more than worthi replac for her the charismat and hunki georg hilton is reliabl a alway in his role of insur investig and duh ladi man delux if you re a fan of giallo don t wait a long a i did to watch this film

this is a dramat film in the whole sen of the word it tell a tail that here in greec we live a a routin in everyday life without realiz how sad it is sure it ha some extrem but everi now and then real life sorrow surpass art it is deepli critic of the goal we pursu and the whole social structur build around them the film ha a deeper understand of greek way of life stereotyp and social structur unlik most greek film that have a certain fast food mainstream audienc this one doe not target anyon in particular but while you watch it you feel that someon put the best possibl word and pictur to describ your feel i am not a big fan of tradit music either but i wouldn t like to hear anyth el when it wa play dure the film if someon told me to say someth against this film i d defin the follow sometim the transit between scene seem sudden or somewhat cut i guess the edit had to cut it up to fit the hour and a bit for the theatr anyway i could write more and more to express my thought over this but i guess u have to see it and discus it with a friend a must see
 
 
 
after have seen a lot of greek movi i feel veri suspici against most of them but after watch this i felt astonish the movi is great without a big tri you cannot claim that the screenplay is so great or the photographi is perfect or someth technic it s a real stori and it is happen in greek rural area in place forgotten from god the movi is like a punch in the stomach and i would realli wish that thing are not like this it obvious talk about the xenophobia of the greek peopl the ignor to anyth differ the problem of this guy is not that he is an ex convict the problem is that he is not one of these peopl he is differ and they do not want them that s whi all the good thing he is do turn boomerang to him and also speak about the apathi of the peopl becaus there are some peopl who are against the hunt of the king but they do not dare to say their opinion in the end you can clear see the hypocrisi of the societi be religi and tri to act like god say but at the same time act so unfair to the king this show how easili peopl ration their feel or their belief accord to the establish system in the end you can have a posit lesson from this veri bad stori mean that you can understand and be part of this societi onli if you want to becom one of them if you want to remain differ and even alon you are lost and it is not far from realiti i think it is tragic that the stori is real and this should be a bell for everybodi no comment for the main actor becaus he is alreadi given an award and i believ that his play wa great small comment for hatzisavva play the policeman he is like a dinosaur he ha play a lot of role and i m sure that this role for him wa veri easi but he play it so great that you cannot deni him a big bravo i definit recommend this movi to anybodi who want to see a good greek movi

this movi start out hilari from about the second mark and continu it throughout the movi i cannot recal a scene where i didn t turn to look at peopl laugh with me he is the perfect actor for this roll becaus of the way he look and the way he dress the comed part were great to see from actor not veri big or popular a you can see peopl do like this movi it is current rate on imdb i think it should be in let put it this way i haven t seen this funni of a movi sinc american pie or the origin vacat see it if you want a laugh i give this movi of the highest thumb up i have ever given sinc i found out about imdb great movi site 
 
 
 
this movi is a riot i cannot rememb the last time i had such a great time at the movi i ve seen a few good comedi in my time and usual they are pretti funni but this one is wall to wall great line i think best in show is the last movi that i laugh so hard and so much in the movi wa non stop until the end when they did the minut of sentiment plot clean up other than that it s a constant barrag of one liner and goofi situat i d like to see it again befor it leav the theater becaus this is like the zucker movi where you don t get all the joke the first time around you have to see it two or three time to get it all in a far a the actual film goe it could have use a better edit it s choppi at time but we have to be forgiv for that all the charact are great it s not like an adam sandler movi where he tri to be funni and everyon el suffer around him and is the butt of the joke i think i will rememb all the main charact for year to come becaus they are all so likabl no victim in this movi also thank god they got a year old actress to play his girlfriend catherin keener play her and she is a sweetheart in this film you just wish that woman like her realli exist she s not a like some of the other lead ladi but somehow her smile is warmer than julia robert overdon overbit if you see the trailer for this film you may not think too high of it i assur you the trailer doe not do it justic they do not give away all the good joke just some of the mediocr one oh and one more thing i hope critic put this on their top ten list mani of them complain that comedi don t get the recognit they deserv and then at the end of the year they don t put it on their list this mean you ebert 
 
 
 
the key to the year old virgin is not mere that andi stitzer is a year old virgin but rather the manner in which steve carel present him a one in a genr of crass comedi that ha becom typifi by it lack of humor and engag charact the year old virgin offer a color cast and an intellig heartfelt script that doesn t use it protagonist a the butt end of cruel joke that andi is still a virgin at forti year old is not a much a joke in fact a it is a curio carel a veteran of team ferrel in anchorman and an ex daili show castmemb use the concept of the film to expand his charact we get to understand whi andi is the way he is it s the littl thing that make this film work when andi s co worker at an electron store ask him what he did for the weekend andi describ his fail effort at cook when andi ride his bike to work he signal his turn he doesn t just adorn his home with action figur he paint them and talk to them and reveal that some of the realli old one have belong to him sinc childhood a lesser comedi wouldn t even begin to focus on all of these thing the plot is fair simplist andi s co worker pal find out he s never had sex and they make it a person quest of their to get him in bed with a woman it s a childish idea and the film make no attempt to conceal it juvenil andi s friend are a complement to his neurot natur david paul rudd ha broken up with his girlfriend over two year ago but is still ob with her jay romani malco is a woman ladi man and cal seth rogen is a tattoo sexahol their attempt at get andi in the sack backfir numer time and each time leav andi feel le and le optimist final andi meet singl mom trish play by catherin keener and much to the chagrin of his worri buddi who claim mother aren t worth it he fall in love with her they begin a relationship and agre to put off have sex for twenti day trish be unawar that andi is still a virgin the year old virgin wa direct by judd apatow the man who produc anchorman and the cabl guy and began the short live cult tv show freak and geek apatow is renown for his uniqu sen of humor and the script co written by carel offer plenti howev in the end the most interest and inde surpris aspect of the year old virgin is it matur by now you are probabl well awar that the film receiv glow review from the critic and even i wa surpris by it warm recept but after see the film it s easi to understand whi we like andi we care about him he s not just some cardboard cutout sex comedi clich he s a real live breath person his neurot trait combin the best of woodi allen with childish naiveti his friend are not unlik jerk and his romanc is tumultu and bittersweet it strike a chord with the audienc although this is far from be a perfect movi and definit contain some rather crude innuendo and sexual humor it doesn t offend to the extent that other genr entri might have becaus we have affect for the peopl on screen the best sex comedi work this way from riski busi to american pie and that is the major differ between someth like the year old virgin and day and night 
 
 
 
i m not quit sure if the term serious comedi appli to this movi im not even sure if this can be appli on the last few year movi theater have becom fill with comedi movi which are way too stupid to even make u grin therefor i consid the movi which do not fill these requir a serious comedi doe the year old virgin fit into this guild that is final up to you but in my opinion this is a veri funni movi you get to laugh a lot plus it deliv a social commentari through some realli great charact and situat i m pretti there is more than one year old virgin out there and even the peopl whom do not exact fit this specif may feel identifi by one of the charact in the movi especi men the stori a the titl say it is about andi a shi silent guy whom collect action figur watch survivor with his octogenarian neighbor and whose favorit band is asia kal is andi s co worker at smarttech he believ andi to be a psychopath until andi s secret is reveal kal is clear a sexual pervert but yet he seem to get what he want with the opposit genr david is the passion guy who is still in love with his ex girlfriend whom ran away with anoth guy and jay a man in a relationship which seem to be affect by his continu cheat and get caught act i m pretti sure most youngster from to have alreadi watch this film but it realli doe not have an age limit to be abl to enjoy it so in case you haven t seen it and will enjoy a littl laugh with social commentari than go to your video store and rest from those deep and depress independ film it also includ dvd bonus which you ll realli see from top to bottom

i caught even in the cinema with a ladi friend even is a chick flick with no apolog for be such but i can say with some relief that it s not so infus with estrogen that it s pain for a red blood male to watch except for a singl instanc at the veri end of the movi i watch with interest and did not have to turn away or roll my eye at ani self indulg melodrama ladi for their part will absolut love this movi ann lord is elder bed ridden and spend her last few day on earth a comfort a possibl in her own home with her two grown daughter at her side discomfit by the memori of her past ann sudden call out a man s name her daughter have never heard befor harri while both of her daughter silent contempl the signific of their mother s strong urg to recal and redress her ill fate affair with this mysteri man at this of all time ann lap back in her head to the fate day she met harri and in do so lost the youth optim for the futur that we all inevit part way with both ann and her two daughter one marri with child one a serial commitophob struggl with the central question of whether true love realli exist and perhap more import if true love can endur the test of time are we all one day fate to realiz that love never last forev will we all realiz that settl for the imperfect is the onli realist outcom the subtl fact that the age ann is still wrestl with an answer to these question on her deathb is not lost on her two daughter the cinematographi for even is interest most of the film is spent in ann s mind a she recal the past and for that reason i think the film wa shot a if it wa all deliber overexpos to give everyon an ether glow and thus make it veri obvious that all of this is not real but occur in the past clair dane is beauti appear to be realli realli tall though just in realiti and is absolut captiv in one climact scene where her sing talent are final put to the test you can t realli talk trash about the cast which lead off with clair dane and doesn t let up from there vanessa redgrav patrick wilson meryl streep and glenn close fill out the other major and minor role in the film i can t realli say anyth negat about this film at all though hugh danci s struggl to have his charact emerg from utter one dimension is in the end a total loss play the spoil lovabl drunk offspr of the obscen rich who put up a front of great bravado but is secret scare stiff of never amount to anyth probabl doesn t offer much in the way of charact explor he had his order and stuck to them in the end gentleman your ladi friend will most certain weep and while you ll like not feel near a affect the even will definit not be a wast for the time spent watch even catch it in theatr or grab it a a rental to trade off for point for when you want to be accompani to a view of die hard or the upcom rambo flick it ll be your littl secret that this view didn t realli cost you much at all 
 
 
 
sinc start to read the book this movi is base on i m have mix feel about the film result i learn some time ago to see the movi adapt of a book befor i read the book becaus i found that if i read the book first i wa inevit disappoint in the film this would undoubt have been true here wherea in the case of aton which is probabl the best film adapt of a book i ve ever seen it would probabl not have matter i m tri to figur out what the caus is and i suspect that i have to point my finger squar at michael cunningham much a i respect him for the hour which i have not read but which i saw and wa awe by i cannot escap the feel that he not so much adapt susan minton s book a he did take a few of the charact and the basic premis and write his own movi out of it it s not that i dislik the movi i actual love the movi which is whi sinc i start read the novel i m feel disturb about the whole thing i feel disloy to m minton for enjoy the movi which wa so thoough a departur from her work read it i can understand whi she had such a struggl adapt it unlik what one review of the movi said it s not so much that some novel don t deserv to be a movi it s more like some book just can t make the transit m minton s novel oper on a level so person and intim to her central charact so intern that it seem imposs to me to place it in a physic realm even though a lot of the book is memori of real event it is memori and so fragment and ether a to be i feel not filmabl i think that m minton s work is a real work of literatur but cannot make the transit to film which in no way detract from it valu i cannot yet report that even the film doe not repres even the novel in ani more than the most superfici way sinc i m onli halfway through but the origin would have to make a tremend leap to resembl the film that follow at this point i guess i m write this becaus i feel that if you re go to adapt a novel adapt it but don t make it someth el that it s not i m not sure if michael cunningham ha done anyth wholli origin but from what i can see so far the thing he ha done are all base on someon el s work we would not have the hour if virginia woolf had not written mr dalloway and we would not have even in it distress form if susan minton had not had so much troubl do what probabl should not have been attempt in the first place but it s too much to say that it would be better if m minton had left well enough alon becaus even the film is a satisfactori and beauti work of it own thus my confus mix feel sen of disloyalti and ultim conclus that in this case the novel cannot be the film and vice versa and my eventu gratitud to both writer for do what they did so that we have both work a they are
