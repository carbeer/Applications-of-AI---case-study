shame on yash raj film and aditya chopra who seem to have lost their intellig over the year and provid steadi fare of tripe in this piec of cinemat crap that not even worth you tube standard i wa grit my teeth throughout the whole flick start to finish with the schizophren direct plot line that never quit materi and on the last scene i just felt asham that my countri and it crorepati film maker can throw away crore on such stupid shame on the actor for take this work and even comment on it a some piec of work they can own up to saif ali khan complet disappoint in your choic of film kareen show enough skin for the puberti stricken and akshay come up a the dim wit anil anoth retard with a pubesc fascin for english his croni were commend in their act and with the bizarr cinematographi scatter in the last minut it wa enough to pop a blood vessel don t wast ani brain cell energi or your money to go see this go see rent amu with konkana sensharma instead a beauti piec of independ film that ever come out of india intellig poignant and a wonder stori tale that will touch everyon with intellig actor and gave me hope that all is not lost in indian cinema make 
 
 
 
if this is a product from one of the biggest product hous of indian film industri yash raj then i am afraid it is a veri long ahead for u to reach the right standard if you can go wrong to this length with such an enorm star cast of anil akshay saif and kareena then movi make is still to be studi much harder by everyon associ with this film the film lack in almost all depart except cinematographi and akshay kumar he ha a few good dialogu to render but that alon cannot make you enjoy a flick with huge expect the first scene of a car go down into a river from the mountain ha veri cheap graphic like that of a cartoon film that itself wa a clear indic of the director s vision everi actor who otherwis is an asset to a movi is simpli wast anil kapoor s gimmick of attempt good english fall flat most of the time and saif will sure hit himself think whi he sign this movi in short it s the biggest wast of resours after jhoom barabar jhoom i would say that even aaja nachl wa a better enjoy movi than this one cannot understand how and whi this kind of script wa written and approv the most unwant wa the flashback sequenc of akshay s love stori after the faulti script the weakest point of the movi is it music vishal shekhar have given just some filler tune to each song the song start off veri well and sudden the tune drop drastic onli one song falak tak chal is somehow good of all in the lot an opportun wast by vishal shekhar regard the continu intellig of the maker just sampl this akshay and saif are on the road in the hilli area of a foreign locat probabl ladakh in the next scene they are search for kareena in haridwar and then back in the hill with kareena in the dicki of their car i am still think who wrote this if you manag to sit till the last then the climax is too long with silli and unnecessari stunt you can see all the hero walk through the storm of bullet not hurt a if they are god are we still see a movi with all these technic height achiev so no more word on this pathet and downgrad movi but a sincer request to senior actor from their fan dear anil kapoor akshay kumar if possibl plea ask for a preview of your movi after their first copi is out a artist of such statur you have certain respons toward your fan and viewer peopl still clap for you a you enter the screen in your first scene respect i think this kind of movi should not see the daylight a it hamper the reput of all associ with the movi the actor and the product hous both 
 
 
 
the action in this movi beat sunni bhai in gadar akshay kumar posse the superpow of leonidus in neo in matrix along with spiderman and superman it is hilari except for the typic akshay kumar and anil kapoor comedi i cannot see anyth posit in this film the stori look like the writer told his yr old son to write the movi is so unreal that anil kapoor long rang shoot with a shotgun is the least most mistak by the director except for the director tashan to make this movi there is no other tashan i regret wast my money on this movi and i would not recommend it to anybodi is the least i can give on imdb or i would give it a zero 
 
 
 
i just saw the movi in theater the movi ha veri few good point to talk about kareena s beauti and a coupl of song may be that it the movi is a complet disappoint in all area anyon associ with the movi will be disappoint even mumbai indian too just now chennai ha made it to semi final but the worst i feel about the movi is the action scene now day bollywood is tri to copi action scene from hollywood but they forget that hollywood director take a lot effect to make it look like real but unfortun bollywood director do not have that much of time they spend their time on song and public of the movi now such too stupid action scene may work in south a the audienc just pay to watch their favorit actor kill bunch of peopl but in bollywood this is certain not go to work all the action scene i wish i could have forward at the end even some chine peopl appear from nowher to beat akshay kumar this is height of stupid audienc is not pay to watch such stupid i think bollywood now should forget about the action movi they cant make it the last good action i have seen wa from ghatak and khiladiyon ka khialdi the current scene in bollywood is realli sad for action movi fan like me doe these peopl see their movi after complet can t they figur out that the slow motion action which is done use rope is too unrealist and childish better not to have action scene if you cant handl it i just want to go back to amitabh s era where movi like zanjeer and deewar were have thrill action scene the sound effect wa not veri effect in those day but visual it is much better than current era scene this movi now should open the eye of the bollywood movi director plea don t make ani more action movi until you acquir the art of make it realist

the first part of greas with john travolta and olivia newton john is one of the best movi for teen this one is a veri bad copi the chang is onli in the sex in the first one the good one wa sandi here it s michael i prefer to watch the first greas 
 
 
 
the tenuous connect between this film and the first greas is establish right at the begin of the film when didi conn one of four cast member repeat their role approach young maxwel caulfield who is a british exchang student although in the previous film olivia newton st john s foreign speech pattern is not explain it s explain here caulfield is her cousin what s conn still do in school i guess she just like hang around rydel high even though now she s a beautician caulfield s a smart kid so of cours the hood type led by adrian zmed have him label a a nerd and that s especi bad when zmed s girl friend decid she like caulfield but be a nerd just isn t go to cut it that s when caulfield decid to put on a modern day zorro act he get a junk bicycl and put it back togeth and teach himself to ride he get himself a leather biker outfit with a set of goggl to hide his face if get michell pheiffer is not in the card caulfield won t have ani troubl make friend at ani gay male leather bar the way he s outfit greas introduc michell pheiffer and maxwel caulfield and start them on the success career path both have enjoy if you saw the first greas film a much better film than you definit have an idea how this film will turn out in addit to conn eve arden sid caesar and dodi goodman all faculti member from the origin greas return in their role the music score isn t remot a good a the song that come from the origin it s not that greas is bad it s just not all that great

this hitchcock movi bear littl similar to his later suspens film and seem much more like a veri old fashion moral tale a young coupl receiv an inherit that they believ will make them happi they spend the money travel about the world and live a veri hedonist exist howev after a while the excit begin to wane and the coupl becom dissip and pointless in their exist howev out of no where when they are on a luxuri cruis the ship sink and they lose everyth and end up much happier in the end becaus they now appreci life what an odd silli and preachi film person i d like to inherit all that money and find out if it make me miser the product valu are relat poor compar to later product a rough film with poor sound qualiti and rather amateurish act 
 
 
 
i imagin when hitchcock scholar and expert find themselv togeth the talk is not of the master s great film like north by northwest or stranger on a train but a lesser known effort like this one from obscur and serious flaw which showcas the great director in fledgl form emili and fred hill joan barri and harri kendal are a middl class london coupl scrimp to stay ahead he begrudg their lot she accept it chang come in the form of a letter from an uncl say he will set them up so they can enjoy a life of globetrot luxuri they make plan for a world cruis but their problem have onli begun just ask richard hannay roger o thornhil or marion crane well marion s indispos at the moment but you get the idea travel and hitchcock go togeth like moth and candlelight set one up for a peril journey at best this is perhap hitchcock s earliest foray into this theme and not his most success or memor hitchcock tri to mix comedi with anoth element in this case domest drama rather than suspens but the two do not coher at least not here the hill are a dull flat coupl with no chemistri or person when they find themselv at the foli berg re in the form of cross cut with footag that look ten year older than the rest of this film they are abash at the outfit of the femal perform the curtain s gone up too soon gasp emili they aren t dress when the hill drift away from each other on an ocean cruis it seem a merci kill more than a tragic thing even if the peopl they partner off with are drip too emili s man gordon perci marmont carri around photograph of himself sit next to empti chair which he suggest be fill by emili fred s girl the princess betti amann ha clara bow s eye and wallac beeri s five o clock shadow there s also an obnoxi fellow passeng a dowdi spinster whom hitchcock alway introduc with a cartoonish horn cue subtleti wa still to come everyth is shot in an abrupt manner with confus block and strain dialogu hitchcock tri for some earli comedi with fred and his umbrella that doesn t come off and kendal seem to aim for laugh while berri play for tear when fred and emili break off they are seen be jostl on a pair of wedg togeth rickshaw one of mani clunki attempt at symbol emili s the onli vagu sympathet charact in part becaus she realli care about her husband and agon over her affair with gordon but most becaus she s among the first of hitchcock s mani magnet blond her platinum ringlet whip around her face like a botticelli aboard the open deck of a chine junk near the film s conclus matter conclud with a danger situat a set piec for the protagonist to come to grip with and presum repair their relationship onli they aren t activ particip in the resolut and except for the fate of a friend cat noth about the end reson at least you get some enjoy view of london in the earli s and a chanc to see hitchcock when he wa still work for food rich and strang is hitchcock pay his due and learn his trade one for scholar but not casual film goer 
 
 
 
there is no suspens in this serial when one episod end the act is so shoddi the effect are so poor and the script is so aw that the last thing on your mind is how batman and robin will save the day no in fact the last thing on your mind is watch the next episod this show is so bore that i can t see how it ever got made let alon releas on dvd obvious the effect are not up to par with contemporari batman film but even the script is aw an incoher babbl mess about some evil professor and a ray gun or someth like that i am not quit sure becaus it is too aw to follow watch the s version or the s version or even batman begin just anyth over this version 
 
 
 
he wa my hero for all time until he went along with if you can call it a movi i went to the show to watch it and come out and not just ask for me money back but ask for doubl the money that how bad my hero s act and the hole thing wa i can t believ that steven segal s career ha hit so low that he ha been reduc to make th rate film with th rate secondari actor i watch this move expect to see him beet the crap out of some peopl the way he usual doe when he is reduc to use a singl judo chop between the shoulder blade to take out an oppon and the guy fall like a ton of brick someth is wrong the plot is unbeliev a a movi and even if you excus the visual and had read this stori a a novel you d be left wonder whi you had even pick up the book steven segal goe through the motion and seem a if he is onli do this becaus he is under oblig he show no effort and no enthusiasm and in some scene he doesn t show up at all i hate to repeat other peopl comment but the use of stock footag for cut scene and for visual of the aircraft in flight is pathet the condit of those scene chop in is shaki and scene themselv seem to have deterior over time the zapprud film show presid john f kennedi be assassin is steadier and cleaner my honest opinion is to tell you not to wast your time see this movi it is not up to the standard of his work in the glimmer man or exit wound i read one review that said the movi had a million dollar budget segal be paid of that and that the movi still came in under budget i must concur it is no wonder that this is a direct to dvd movi a no conscienti theater owner would play this movi 
 
 
 
i can bare find the word to express how utter utter aw this film is i wa sold on the promis of action with segal and stealth aircraft which normal make for an entertain action movi i can honest say i d rather goug my eye out with a cocktail stick than have to see this film again the act wa so aw that it wa almost funni the stori wa insan weak with plot hole so cavern wide you could fli an f through them the script wa so poor if i found out that a year old wrote it i shouldn t be in the least surpris the direct and product is so amateur i wouldn t even hire these peopl to shoot my worst enemi wed video utter utter drivel those respons for make this movi have cheapen the art and they should be asham of themselv steven segal should never ever show his face in public again i can t imagin what made him agre to star in this the worst film i have seen in my entir life 
 
 
 
how can there be that mani corrupt cop without ani one of them slip up with enough cop to run a mini war that includ such weapon a flamethrow you would think they would have been caught befor someon write for a week coupon newspap overheard someon say thank to a corrupt cop you will never get your ish minut back life is too precious to rent this movi i feel bad for the big name actor that made the mistak of make this movi if you like justin timberlak feel free to rent this movi he doe have a veri major part in it so fan might enjoy see him howev i believ most of his fan are young girl who may be turn off by the violenc in this movi 
 
 
 
i own almost everi seagal movi yes even one like this that are low budget and i must say this may be the worst not onli of his movi but of all movi ever made the onli highlight of this film and onli reason i gave it star instead of is that a it is seagal and b seagal doe have some sweet action sequenc specif in the store and also when ever el he take out an entir armi with a knife next time give me minut of seagal kill peopl and don t even bother with a stori line becaus the storylin not onli stunk but so did the act the fact that f s and f s somehow chang into f s and also the fact that the stealth wa a fast a an f also the stealth never had to refuel and sinc when is afghanistan consid hostil territori from an air forc stand point last i check afghanistan ha no air forc we usa control the sky also this top secret mission wa play through speaker to all the crew in the room yet the admir still whisper to the other guy that it is secret also how did seagal go from the bottom of the truck to the top plea tell u whi they jail him sinc when are air forc pilot great commando unless they are owen wilson and sinc when are their drunk in arab countri consid muslim don t drink alcohol also on top of that sinc when do arab listen to order from femal like the in charg the highlight of the film wa definit seagal kill peopl in the store and the other peopl he kill with a knife a well a the veri brief and total random lesbian scene that came out of nowher 
 
 
 
unless you are mental ill or the most die hard segal fan you will tire of this horrend excus for a film in under minut the plot even for a seagal film the plot is just stupid i mean it not just bad it bare coher the act unbeliev wooden liter seen better act in porno s iron this film tri to cash in on this audienc which a lesbian love scene which is utter cring worthi special effect wouldn t look out of place in a s sword and sorceri flick unless you suffer from insomnia and have exhaust all other cure don t make the same mistak a i did and buy this dvd a you will be ask for that hour and a half of your life back 
 
 
 
i just watch this movi on starz let me go through a few thing i thought could have been improv the act write direct special effect camera crew sound and light it also seem a though the writer had no idea anyth that had to do with the movi appar back in when the dollar wa stronger you could buy a super advanc stealth bomber that could go complet invis for million now a day those thing cost about billion and they cant go invis appar you can fli from the u to the middl east in an hour there wa a complet random lesbian scene which i didn t mind but it seem like a lame attempt to get more guy to see it the camera would random zoom in on actor and skip to random scene oh yeah sinc it a steven segal movi it predict a hell all in all i rank it right up there with snake on a plane 
 
 
 
nobodi could like this movi for it merit but if you have a sen of humor and enjoy schlock movi for their mst qualiti then this is for you it rank up there with road hous for it preposter charact set and stori line the bad write realli crack me up i want you to dust those guy off instead of dust those guy f s take off from the carrier but when they get into format they re f s without a hint of anger or skeptic segal goe back to work for the general who onli minut befor wa overse a covert mind wipe on seagal segal run out of bullet and resort to a knife to kill the guard so natur the guard all drop their gun and fight with knive too the hand grenad is a dud but explod anyway the littl stealth fighter can fli all the way from california to afganistan without refuel then segal fli it back to california the long way i e by way of europ even though there s a carrier give him air support minut away in the arabian sea the cic in the carrier consist of black pc flat screen tv and pictur of gaug and map on the wall what a hoot 
 
 
 
first of all f is not high tech ani more and it is not a fighter aircraft second the f s and f s cannot chang their appear they are not transform third the f ha onli one m cannon not two last but not the least at the end of the film seagl select sidewind missil but somehow when he pull the trigger the actual missil fire turn out to be a maverick a i have the experi of see f s and f s be mysteri transform into f s this small transform of missil is not a big surpris to me howev there is still one question i have to ask how did they manag to use an air to ground missil to shoot down a fli f when student hand in realli bad work teacher assign s now i think for the sake of proper mark this film imdb should serious consid ad a option otherwis it is not fair for those who receiv out of 
 
 
 
if you watch this movi you know whi i said jesus jesus jesus heheh everi time they said jesus jesus jesus i laugh think jesus jesus jesus whi did i rent this movi i cannot believ how oscar winner like freeman and spacey appear here in the background while timberlak and ll cool j grab the screen wtf is timberlak dreaful act i think someon like joshua jackson could have done a much better job this job wa perfect for joshua jackson and believ me i am not a big fun of him but i realli prefer an actor not this android call timberlak and his girlfriend wa shallow hollow and annoy a hell i wa happi when they both were pop in the street the stori wa ok and i think dylan mc dermott did his bad guy role veri well the movi wa entertain but i think timberlak ruin it all it would have been much enjoy without him by the way the music wa ok but sudden everi time the music appear the movi turn into a mtv video clip with flash low motion and thing like that someth misplac for this cop movi i thought mayb they want to make a mtv video clip for timberlak 
 
 
 
this movi should have never been made what a shame of the budget plea hire convinc actor and make a proper movi veri thin plot and unconvinc line almost hilari and that is a shame for an action movi definit not worth watch they keep replay the same shot of an stealth airplan fli away you have seen it one and that wa not worth re run or time it is time for steven seagal to retir from movi make his movi are get worser everi time black dawn and submerg were alreadi bad but this movi is even wors 
 
 
 
steven seagal mr person himself this time is the unit state greatest stealth pilot who is promis a pardon from the militari who attempt to swipe his memori at the begin of the movi for which he escap base later caught after interrupt a gang of robber in a shootout at a gas station if he is abl to success infiltr a northern afghanistan terrorist base oper by a group call black sunday who have command an air forc stealth fighter thank to an american traitor along with a fellow pilot who admir the traitor jannick mark bazeley john sand seagal will fli into enemi territori receiv help from his arab lover jessica ciera payton and a freedom fighter rojar alki david onc they are on ground jannick is kidnap by black sunday leader stone vincenzo nicoli and his femal enforc eliana kati jone and sand must figur out how to not onli re take command of the kidnap stealth fighter but rescu him a well and mayb sand can get reveng on the traitor he train rather steve toussaint in the process sand ha hour until a general s navi pilot bomb the entir area on board the stealth black sunday equip a biochem bomb hope to deton it on the unit state seagal get a chanc to shoot afghan when he isn t slice their throat with knive the film is most machin gun fire and bodi drop dead the set of afghanistan doesn t hold up to scrutini nor doe how easili seagal and co are abl to move about the area undetect so easili and the plot itself is noth to write home about the movi is edit fast the camera a bit too jerki seagal isn t a activ a hero a he onc wa and his action scene are tight edit where we have a hard time see him take out his foe unlik the good old day one of seagal s poorest effort and he s a underst a ever not a compliment even more disappoint is the fact that seagal never fight in hand to hand combat with the film s chief villain ti a shame he doesn t even snap a wrist or crack a neck in ani visibl way sure we see a slight resembl of some tool get toss around but it s not a clear a pictur a i enjoy becaus the filmmak have such fast edit and dizzi close up

i have read sever good review that have defend and critis the various aspect of this film one thing i see over and over is annoy with megan the idealist polit scientist tri to chang the world i love her charact mayb becaus i am a year old polit scienc student and i think i m go to chang the world too so i relat to megan besid she s cute she s no super model but more of a cute girl next door ok so she cri and scream a lot it s veri dramat and seem overdon but doesn t it fit her charact she goe on that show with the intent of sacrif her life to prove a point she think peopl who enjoy such a show are sick i think she made her argument veri well of cours be a young naiv girl she is terrifi of what she is about to face i think her act accur portray a young girl show moral courag despit her overwhelm fear furthermor i think she maintain a certain digniti throughout the film despit the desper situat she wa in a for the movi in general other than megan it wa pretti much what i expect it had excel gore scene by micro budget standard the plot mayb took a quick thought hard ani contempl it s basic just a dark humorist senseless slasher film which the name impli i love the sadism of the doctor he kept rip megan s shirt off not just for the caus of sleaz though larg so but also to torment her befor he kill her the chainsaw hick wa hilari for slasher film lover he wa probabl the best charact i give this film out of it had a good set almost no plot and a mix of good and terribl act i would recommend it for a cheap thrill but hard a diamond in the rough that is micro budget horror 
 
 
 
slasher well if you like horror it definit one to see otherwis don t even bother it is complet obvious that this film ha an extrem low budget for instanc it look a if the entir film ha been shot in a warehous somewher and on numer occas you will see the mike boom shadow and the camera man shadow trust me you wont need to look for them also tri to ignor the cheesi actor if that what you call them the basic outlin is a few peopl decid to go on a game show where they have to surviv a night in a big maze due to their be killer on the loo and whoever live s at the end get rich now there is someth about this film that keep you watch and rare do you find that with a cheap budget horror these day for exampl when i watch it i thought to my self i would nt mind have a go at this game especi for so anyway i would recommend you watch it and make up your own mind

pathet wors than a bad made for tv movi i can t believ that spacey and freeman were in this flick for some reason morgan freeman s charact is constant talk about and say pussi when refer to nsync boy s girlfriend morgan freeman call woman pussi is just awkward what the hell were the peopl behind this film think too mani plot hole to imagin combin with the horrid act confus camera angl a lame script and cheap background music made this movi absolut unbear i rent this flop with low expect but well it realli suck 
 
 
 
when think of the revel that the main charact in bubbl come to at film end i am remind of last year machinist with christian bale the onli differ between the two film is the liter physic weight of the charact an underst yet entir realist portray of small town life the titl is caus for contempl perhap we the audienc are the one in the bubbl a we are given no payoff in the film slim minut run time audienc reaction were often smug and judgment clear indic how detach peopl can be from see ani thread of human in charact so foreign to themselv these charact are the one peopl refer to a those that put georg w back in offic for a second term it s sober to consid how realiti televis ha spoil our sen of realiti when watch an audienc jump to their foot for the exit a soon a the credit role this film ha it s merit and is deserv of consider for the thing it doesn t say outright 
 
 
 
san francisco is a big citi with great act credit in this one the filmmak made no attempt to use the citi they didn t even manag the most basic of realist detail so i would not recommend it to anyon on the basi of be a san francisco movi you will not be think oh i ve been there you will be think how did a two stori firetrap stinki armpit turn into a quiet hotel lobbi some of the lead use east coast speech style and affect it detract but the act wa alway compet the stori seem to be shot in three distinct style at least in the begin the chinatown stori wa the most effect and interest the plot is weak rip scene for scene from classi hong kong action movi the origin had a lot more tension and emot reson they were frame and pace better but the act is fun and we get to see jame hong and other luminari the white boy intro wa pointless i think the filmmak didn t know what to do with it so they left it loo structur and cut it down the father is an odd attempt at a berkeley liber realli folk everyon know it s not groovi to live in the ghetto but his segment are the most humor they threw away some good opportun educ and embitt on the west coast a yuppi jerk here is a differ kind of yuppi jerk than they make in new york they are equal intoler but alway distinguish that would have been interest this wa not the hunter s point intro wa the most disappoint it wa the most deriv of the three and stylist the most distant from san francisco you ve seen it done befor and you ve seen it done better even the video game wa better despit the generic non local and aimless script these charact have potenti the actor have talent and someth interest start to forc it way around the clumsi direct about ten minut befor the end good concept place in the wrong hand p there is a miss minor here see if you can guess which one

this minut documentari bu uel made in the earli s about one of spain s poorest region is in my opinion one of his weakest film first let s admit that year later spain is much richer than it wa then and when i say this i fulli admit that wealth can bring problem of it own like excess individu and consumer though all in all wealth it s a far better condit than the extrem poverti portray here and if poverti reced in spain it wa not exact with the sort of social that bu uel favor but with western european style capit but one of the most shock thing about the movi is this in one scene the narrat chide that in school child are taught the valu of pi teach math to poor peopl the horror bu uel shortsighted is at it most glare here not realiz that it is access to the latest knowledg and technolog what will help the poor overcom their situat what is he propos that child are taught exact what at school doesn t bu uel understand that it is the lack of modern technolog that ha made them poor in comparison with other peopl 
 
 
 
the writer director of this film obvious doesn t know anyth about film i think the dp on this project wa tie up and replac with a monkey becaus everi seen wa either too dark or had the hotter hot spot than the sun the stori wa aw the charact were veri one dimension for someon to have said that this film wa made for poker fan and not film fan that someon is kid their self it wa probabl the writer director no poker fan in this world like this movi even your money man hate this project to go into a casino and play a few hand doesn t give you the experi to write about poker keep your day job and if it s play poker then you must be hurt n

murder by number is one of those movi that you expect is made for tv but isn t consid the onli actor of ani note is bullock although michael pitt seem to be move onto bigger and better thing it isn t a great surpris that this movi quick fade away from memori to be replac by more import thing like rememb to lock your front door when you go out or put cloth back on when you come out of the shower bullock play cassi mayweath a cop with person issu don t they all togeth with her new partner a wet look ben chaplin she is call to investig the murder of a young woman noth unusu there except that the perp are a coupl of teenag student who think they ve plan and execut the perfect murder a the investig continu a battl of will emerg between cassi and the main suspect richi haywood ryan gosl the crippl issu here is that the two lead are hopeless bullock though she is veri nice to look at is about a believ in the role of a harden cynic cop a rodney dangerfield actual he d be better chaplin for his sin is a complet non entiti and i feel sorri that he ha to put this film on his cv in his attempt to break into hollywood at least gosl and pitt a the conniv sneer suspect acquit themselv adequ a if dodgi lead weren t bad enough a stori that would send anybodi to sleep and a high predict but illog end shoot this film in the head befor it ha a chanc to run murder by number ha absolut noth go for it even a pointless nude scene by bullock wouldn t redeem it well just a littl but still not enough to save it forgett predict and redund this is one film that isn t go to move the cop genr forward a cassi probabl say on her next case there s noth to see here peopl move along keep move

 american nightmar is offici tie in my opinion with it s pat for the worst movi of all time seven friend odd resembl the k mart version of the cast of friend gather in a coffe shop to listen to american nightmar a pirat radio show it s host by a guy with a beard that s the most excit aspect of his show chandler monica joey and oh wait i mean wayn jessi and the rest of the bad one liner spout gang all take turn reveal their biggest fear to the beard dj unbeknownst to them a craze nurs serial killer is listen crazi nurs then proceed to tortur ross and rachel and wait sorri again by make their fear come to life these fear includ such stunner a voodoo and be gone down on by old ladi with dentur no realli this movi wa in a word rotten crazi nurs s kill spree lack motiv there s noth to make the viewer jump the end blow and again voodoo if you have absolut no regard for your love one rent american nightmar with them if you care for your love one even a littl bit go to your local blockbust rent all of the copi of american nightmar and hide them in your freezer 
 
 
 
when i read the back of the dvd case i thought that it sound realli interest so i had my mom throw it into the pile of movi in the for dollar section at blockbust when we got home and pop in the movi twenti minut into it we found ourselv turn to each other go this suck let s put in someth el i ll admit a few of the line from the friend at the caf made u smile a littl bit but come on at least get some decent actor everi onc in a while in a movi if the act is bad and the movi isn t go at a pain slow pace and actual seem interest i can gut it out and get a few laugh at how they re over or under do their line but i can onli take so much cri scene look like the actor were have hyster fit of laughter there wa no deliveri for their line amateur doesn t even come close to the act in this film anyon who came on here say that this film wa good had to have been on some realli good drug while they were watch the movi it s the most pointless thing i ve ever had the displeasur of watch do not watch or buy this movi 
 
 
 
when it come to horror movi i am more than will to suspend disbelief ignor sub par product valu and overlook plot hole in the interest of a good scare this movi simpli ha no good scare to offer it can t even be enjoy a camp bad dialogu bad act bad direct the kill were predict and poor stage the music wa annoy the camera work wa wretch even the costum were bad i felt realli bad for the actor who were obvious tri but who had to deal with terribl contriv dialogu and an obvious lack of direct i doubt they got ani rehears either it s embarrass to watch and so bore than make it through to the contriv surpris end requir tremend endur it s quit easili one of the worst movi i ve ever seen i don t normal write review but this one wa so bad that i felt compel to warn other this movi is a complet wast of time if you must watch this movi don t miss the make of featurett the writer director seem to be under the impress that make the killer a woman wa kind of bold dare move seen it he and the cast spend half an hour deconstruct this film a if it s a new age citizen kane it s like listen to a group of third grader take you behind the scene of their christma pageant they truli think they ve creat someth of substanc it s sad realli the onli reason i gave this movi a is becaus i think should be reserv for true atroc like mano hand of fate and space mutini so american nightmar isn t the worst movi i ve ever seen but i d have to say that it s somewher in the bottom fifti

so you might be read some of the comment post on this film and you might be think to yourself huh there were sure a bunch of rave review post on decemb funni thing is most of these rave review sound like they re come from the same person or at best a small coordin group of open hous groupi the truth my friend is that this film is truli unwatch just becaus it s independ doesn t mean it get a free pas if you re go to make a music whether on film or on stage whether on broadway or at the local communiti playhous you should probabl make sure that a your actor can sing b your actor can danc c you have decent sound equip d you have a well written score and e you have lyric that are witti and charm even anthoni rapp can t save this one it s one of those unfortun movi go experi where i actual felt deepli embarrass for everyon involv 
 
 
 
the singl worst film i ve ever seen in a theater i saw this film at the austin film festiv in and it blew my mind that this film wa accept to a festiv it wa an interest premis and seem like it could go somewher but just fell apart everi time it tri to do anyth first of all if you re go to do a music find someon with music talent the music consist of cheesi piano play that sound like they were play it on a stereo in the room they were film the lyric were terribl written and when they weren t obvious rhyme they were groan induc rhyme that show how far they were stretch to tri to make this movi work and you d think you d find peopl who could sing when make a music right not in this case luckili they were half talk half sing in rhyme most of the time but when they did sing it made me cring especi when they attempt to sing in harmoni and that just address the music some of the act wa pretti good but a lot of the dialog wa terribl a well a most of the scene they obvious didn t have enough coverag on the scene or they just had a bad editor becaus they consist jump the line and use terribl choic while cut the film at least the director wa will to admit that no one want the script until they ad the hook of make it a music i hope the investor make sure someon can write music befor make the same mistak again 
 
 
 
did heidijean realli see this movi a great christma movi not even close dull bland and complet lack in imagin and heart i kept watch this movi wonder who the hell thought that car pope could play the lead in this movi the woman ha no detect person and give a complet lacklust perform baranski wa great a usual and provid the onli modicum of interest the whole thing probabl her involv wa the onli reason this project wa green light to begin with mayb i m expect too much for a lifetim movi play day from christma but i sat through this thing think that with a differ director and a recast jj with an actress that at least could elicit sympathi this could have been quit a cute littl movi

have seen men behind the sun i guess i hope for an evolut in style techniqu to match the larger scale of this movi i wa also quit interest to see someon make a hard hit fact base fictionalis account of what happen dure this most notori of japanes atroc but this is not it this play like a bottom to mid tier european nazi exploit movi from the s e g s experi camp etc perhap more like deport woman of the special section actual grant it ha a greater scope and more peopl run around but it resort to the same cheap and cheerless devic of lot of hapless non actor limpli fall over to the sound of ridicul fake gunshot spice up with the occasion poor execut shock sequenc the admit horribl documentari footag is rough splice in between scene so hackney that even these real imag are rob of much of their power watch channel s the holocaust air recent still run a of no for a genuin disturb documentari on the evil of war featur excel in context use of actual footag this is the type of treatment the horror of nanj deserv not this hackney exploit garbag a better execut exploit movi minus the disrespect use of stock footag would have been fine but again this is not even a veri good exploit movi rate a exploit a a treatment of the subject 
 
 
 
although i had no earth idea on what to expect from this movi this sure a hell wasn t what i would have had in mind had anyth actual come to mind onc i heard of it exist all i knew wa that i had to own a movi call plea don t eat the babi unfortun i could onli find a copi under it altern titl island furi look back i guess i could call it a lose lose situat on one hand i still don t get to be known a the guy who own a movi call plea don t eat the babi and on the other hand island furi would ultim reveal itself to be an aw pointless bore unwatch piec of garbag yeah definit lose lose i m not even sure what genr they re go for here just earli s bad with a flashback that might actual be longer than the non flashback first up two teenag girl are be chase by two bad guy onc caught the bad guy bring to our attent that one of the girl have a coin on a string around her neck and somehow these bad guy know of a lot more of these coin hidden on an island somewher and this is where thing start to get weird somehow these guy know of a trip the girl took to some island year earlier when they were onli i guess this is suppos to mean that the girl should know exact where this alleg treasur is so now we re in the past while the girl tri to retrac their step so these bad guy don t kill them although i wouldn t have mind if they had in the flashback the year old counterpart are on a boat trip with their sister and the sister boyfriend eventu stop by an island for some air they get mix up with some kid and his killer grandpar ani potenti suspens or reason to keep on watch never show up but the flashback wa undeni better than the present which still isn t say much for a while there i had forgotten about the origin stori at one point i ithought mayb the director had too and when the flashback end that would be the end which would have work for me consid this disappoint would have been a half hour shorter this pointless movi within a pointless movi doe eventu end and real stuff doe happen but it s stupid i guess i didn t exact expect a movi fill with infant be devour or anyth like that but i did expect some form of outlandish b entertain most just a confus inept storylin unsur of it genr my advic would be to seek out someth worthwhil like attack of the beast creatur if anyon i would onli recommend this one to serious b movi collector who must have them all anyon el interest probabl ha brain damag what realli get me is that i still have no idea whi they call it plea don t eat the babi

 cia codenam alexa is an absolut horribl rip off of luc besson s classic film la femm nikita the film is basic about a woman who is taken in and train by the cia and is forc to do a secret mission for them pretti much the same stori structur of la femm nikita the act combo of lorenzo lama and o j simpson is perhap the worst in cinema histori lama act is simpli a bad steven segal imperson watch orenth act in this film is an excruci experi the write and act is so poor in this film at time it is laughabl there are so mani action movi convent in the film it is ridicul unnecessari car explos peopl fli thru glass window terrorist bad ponytail etc the music score resembl david michael frank s score for hard to kill which further the steven segal theme of this movi there is plenti of martial art in the film and it is pretti well done for a low budget american product the mindless action and over the top act never let up and i have to admit i wa mild entertain lorenzo lama had the look of an action star back in the earli s but he is certain no action star that is whi he is do soap opera and not action blockbust my recommend is that you skip cia codenam alexa and check out la femm nikita instead

this film wa hard to get a hold of and when i eventu saw it the disappoint wa overwhelm i mean this is one of the great stori of the twentieth centuri an unknown man take advantag of the unsuspect airlin industri and get away with million in ransom without hurt anyon or bungl the attempt with all of this built in interest how could anyon make such a lacklust talk laden flick of this true life event while william is alway interest the screenwrit assum that the d b cooper persona wa stereotyp heroic like a movi star s what we get is a type without ani engag detail or insight into the mind of a person dare enough and clever enough to have pull it off harrold practic steal the movi with her spunk and pure beauti but the real letdown wa in the handl of the plot and the lame direct shame on this film for even exist 
 
 
 
a someon who like chase scene and wa realli intrigu by this fascin true life tale i wa optimist head into this film but too mani obstacl got into the way of the good stori it should have been the bad i m a fan of robert duval and mani of the charact he ha play but his role here is a dull one a an insur investig the dialog is insipid and the pretti kathryn harrold is real garbag mouth from what i read there were sever director replac each other on this film and that s too bad you can tell thing aren t right with the stori i couldn t get involv with treat william portray of cooper either he should have been fascin but he wasn t in this movi it s also kind of a sad comment that a guy commit a crime is some sort of folk hero but i admit i wound up root for the guy too not everyth wa disappoint i can t complain about the sceneri from the lush green forest of oregon to the desert in arizona i d like to see this movi re made and done better becaus it is a one of a kind stori 
 
 
 
i can t believ that peopl thought this stink heap of trash wa funni shift the attempt at humor among cruelti disgust and stupid there s someth about mari leav littl reason to stay until the end sure cameron diaz is veri pretti but that is never go to be enough to save a movi ben stiller tri hard to work within the plot and is obvious veri talent but the movi is a loser not onc were ani of the scene believ the shot were bad time and poor frame the farreley brother should be kept away from make film at all cost i check imdb to see what they are work on just so i know what to avoid the bonus is from the one time i smile it s not like i m immun to humor or alon in my opinion my wife hate it too the next day we saw rush hour and laugh ourselv silli this movi just stunk 
 
 
 
to be honest at the time i first heard of this show i though it may be a bad idea to make a show that make muslim use racial joke on themselv but it is the exact opposit i realiz that the show do that can help peopl understand that if a muslim use s a word like this in real life it doesn t mean it is a terrorist thing it also show s how peopl give the muslim a bad name becaus they play on their stereotyp by watch the show regular peopl will realiz that all though there may be bad muslim out it doesn t mean we are all bad we just tri to live day at a time like how hard it wa for amair to get on a plane and how he use word like blow up or yaser say we ll blow away the competit and peopl took it the wrong way be a muslim i know that stuff like this don t usual happen but they do and mani peopl think bad thing about muslim or afghanistan or iraq it not right thing are not like that peopl will see how we are poor treat by watch this show and it may make them think on how the act i am glad a show like this came on the air there are mani show that piotr muslim peopl a terrorist mani peopl do find them funni to my opioion it is ok to do it now and then becaus preti much everyth is made fun of who are we to say you can not make fun of that is unfair but it is done to often and realli give muslin peopl a bad name 
 
 
 
who like aw comedi show like littl mosqu on the prairi the onli two kind of peopl i can think of who watch this are one muslim and self proclaim liber defend of everi ethnic group who are so thrill there is a show about muslim that it doesn t even matter if the show is good or funni at all which it is not two old peopl and peopl whose idea of comedi is incred predict bad written stale joke cbc need to realli take a look at what they are do and who their audienc is if they keep onli write comedi for realli old peopl then guess what will happen their audienc will die off soon and they will have no audienc left i d be curious who even write for this show do you think it s actual muslim or hip funni young peopl no i bet it is old white guy who have been write the same joke for the same kind of bad cbc show sinc the s when you look at the cbc comedi show there are air farc wa onli final just taken off the air thank good but we still have lame duck like this hour ha minut and rick mercer that we are pay for not to mention this poor excus for comedi littl mosqu on the prairi it is suppos to be offenc and funni onli the cbc would think this lame show is at all offenc or funni shame on the cbc for squander our tax dollar on show onli a few peopl would bother watch 
 
 
 
if you re look to be either offend or amus or both you ll probabl have to look elsewher lmotp realli isn t even veri thought provok beyond rehash the usual silli clich s at the end of the second episod i felt a littl embarrass that i actual sat through the contriv mess beyond the thin veil gimmicki premis that attract all the initi attent to it in the first place it s just anoth lame innocu and anti septic attempt at commentari and entertain that the cbc typic excel at produc and onc the zomg muslim in rural canada roflmao hype wear out it welcom the show is like to follow into the ether of cancel becaus it s so shallow when judg on it merit alon unless you re ob with muslim cultur in the west and or are easili amus by the most minut idiosyncrasi on the subject i realli don t see how lmotp is enjoy beyond satisfi the curio that stem from the hype other show have better address the issu of cultur ethnic dichotomi in western multi ethnic societi lmotp will never rank among them in entertain or insight 
 
 
 
i wa excit to see a sitcom that would hope repres indian candian but i found this show to be not funni at all the produc and cast are probabl happi to get both bad and good feed back becaus a far a they are concern it s get talk about i wa readi for some stereotyp and have no problem with it becaus stereotyp exist for a reason they are usual true but there realli wasn t anyth funni about these stereotyp charact the fresh of the boat dad who doesn t understand his daughter the radic feminist muslim daughter who by the way is a terribl actress and the young modern indian man tri to run his mosqu a polit correct a he can he s a pretti good actor i onli see him get better it is veri contriv and the dialog doesn t flow that well there wa so much potenti for someth like this but sad i think it fail and don t realli care to watch anoth episod i did howev enjoy watch a great canadian actress sheila mccarthi again she s alway a treat and a natur at everyth she doe too bad her daughter in the show doesn t have the same act abil 
 
 
 
littl mosqu is one of the most bore cbc comedi i have ever seen they have a way of produc the easiest comedi program they can for the oldest most easili offend viewer which for cbc mean year old farmer in saskatchewan the joke are all predict and so death lame i can t believ it the perform are veri hammi and over act but i don t blame the actor sinc those kind of one dimension stereotyp charact are probabl exact what the cbc ask for and demand veri lame show with bad joke they tri to present a controversi well it is le controversi than the other bore cbc comedi like the hour ha minut royal canadian air farc and rick mercer s report 
 
 
 
this show is a perfect exampl of how the cbc should stick to either news sport or satir sketch comedi a a develop of situat comedi cbc ha shown it can combin the pizazz of king of kensington with the belli laugh of the beachcomb it is an embarrass to great show like kid in the hall and second citi that they have to share their comed root with this lame product i have to admit that i didn t give this show much of a chanc right from when i first heard of it concept to start half of the concept is a direct attempt to rip off one of the few sitcom success in english canadian histori corner gas the rest of the concept the cultur clash is far from be origin and is too often use a a crutch for screen write lazi the select of the muslim religion a the basi for the fish out of water charact seem to be a desper attempt to be edgi and topic but come off a forc some of the joke that are base around the local s reaction to the newcom are cring induc and thorough insult to the intellig of everyon involv especi the audienc this show is a perfect exampl of how cbc just doesn t get it when it come to creat canadian content especi when present canada a a multicultur environ cultur diver in canada doe not have to be present in such a heavi hand and forc way it would be a refresh chang to see cbc introduc diver into a televis show without make the show all about said diver i doubt that cbc ha suffici sitcom talent to pull off someth so subtl a comparison could be made to the way diver is depict in corner gas i e the aborigin charact are not set apart by their ethnic nor is their heritag use to generat stori line more realist their live and the other charact live intertwin in a way that make ethnic no more signific than ani of their other person characterist that be said even a a formula fish out of water comedi this show fail the act is weak the comic pace all over the map and the stori premis that i saw were too far beyond the suspens of belief even for a comedi the onli save grace is the talent derek mcgrath who is horribl wast here i doubt that even the addit of guest star colin mochri for exampl a an anglican archbishop can save this dog i decid to give the show a chanc onc the cbc s hype had die down but two episod were all i could stand i could almost feel my braincel shut themselv down with each fail punchlin the time slot would be better serv by air more coron street air farc re run or dr who even an infomerci would be an improv

i regret everi singl second of the time i lost while watch this movi realli unhappili i alway find it hard to switch off a movi onc i start watch it especi when it s such a classic or what peopl use to call a classic i think that this is one of those movi everi movi lover should have watch at least one time so that wa whi i watch it don t get me wrong i like humphrey bogart and his wife lauren bacal both a a coupl and a actor but this movi wa a big fraud in my opinion no realli good plot neither an espionag flick nor a romant love stori well not even a convinc mixtur of both of these genr onli thing which caus tension wa that it wa uncertain whether bogey and bacal would stay togeth in the end or part from one anoth i think to have and have not is veri overr and bogart wa in mani better film dure the s 
 
 
 
this is one of those film that i could onli sit through onc charlott henri is fine in fact all the actor were fine the problem wa in the script the dialog the direct the edit the set and the special effect grant this wa but it realli creak part of the problem is that actor like richard arlen gari cooper w c field and cari grant are not recogniz there face cri for a recognit that wa not forthcom the movi just clump along with no cohes much of lewi carrol spirit humor and continu are miss what a piti it s such a great book i would recommend disney s version 
 
 
 
i saw this film at a pre releas screen at the writer guild theater in bever hill a i recal the film s produc and director were in attend presum to gage our reaction mani scene evok gale of laughter from the audienc which would have been fine if it had been a comedi but it wa suppos to be a horror film if the audienc wasn t scare it seem the filmmak were they delay releas for over a year out of curio i saw it again to see if they d re cut it a far a i can tell they hadn t it wa the same lousi movi just a year older it almost qualifi a so bad it s good but it s slow pace and bore 
 
 
 
film start in japan in which a man slash his wife and her lover to death and the commit suicid it s a veri gori bloodi sequenc then it jump to present day well to be precis ted edward albert wife laura susan georg and their annoy littl kid move to japan for hubbi s work they rent a hous and surpris surpris it just happen to be the hous where the murder took place the three dead peopl are around a ghost the makeup is hyster bad and make life hell for the famili sound ok but it s realli hopeless there s a bloodi open and end and noth happen in between there is an attack by giant crab which is just uproari they look so fake i swear i saw the string pull one along and they re mutter there s a pointless sex sequenc in the first minut probabl just to show off georg s bodi anoth one about minut later but that wa necessari to the plot and a realli silli exorc toward the end the fight scene between albert and doug mcclure must be seen to be believ a for act albert wa ok a the husband and mcclure wa pretti good a a famili friend but georg a alway is terrif in a lousi film she give this film a much need lift but can t save it i m give this a just for her and the gori open and close that asid this is a veri bore film 
 
 
 
i don t think anyon sit down to view this film would be expect anyth remot appear like a classic ghost stori but you have to ask yourself when it s over if you were ever scare this doesn t realli work on that level but the cast doe tri hard and the film doesn t tack on one of those happi end stori is about an american coupl who travel to kyoto japan so that ted fletcher edward albert can write a book and he bring along his wife laura susan georg and their daughter ami ami barrett their friend alex curti doug mcclure who work at the american consul help them find a hous to live in and he find one that is haunt about year earlier in the same hous a samurai found his wife cheat on him and he kill both of them and then commit suicid their ghost still inhabit the hous and when the fletcher s arriv it doesn t take long befor strang thing start happen spoiler alert at time the ghost inhabit the bodi of the fletcher s and they start to act like the japanes peopl that they were befor and laura start to flirt with alex which lead to an affair meanwhil ted start behav more strict and after he pour soup down the throat of ami he goe to ask a monk for help unfortun the ghost get ted laura and alex to play out their death scene like it happen year earlier this film wa direct by kevin connor who is known a a good televis director but he ha made horror and scienc fiction film befor and ha work with mcclure on some of them while this never come close to be scari or develop atmospher it doe have two thing in it that i like first it doesn t have one of those sappi end where the coupl embrac after defeat the demon instead it end in a veri bloodi fight where everyon succumb to the evil of the ghost second it ha susan georg in the cast i ve alway been a fan of her even though she ha appear in most schlock but her perform are alway top notch also she usual appear nude which she doe here in two separ scene and while she doesn t have classic featur she doe have a uniqu tomboy like look about her and it s one of the reason whi she wa so popular but after appear in silli film such a this i think it led to her get out of the busi or work onli sporad this isn t a bad film but it s never convinc and watch the ghost scurri around when the monk give an exorc is practic worthi of a giggl or two the bottom line is that this is silli and i hope georg decid to resum her career 
 
 
 
the film open with a peac shot of a tradit japanes hous complet with thatch roof that sit on the side of a small hill and an on screen caption appear that read kushiata kyoto japan a young japanes traine samurai name masanori toshiya maruyama walk up the wind path to the hous insid wait otami mako hattori with whom he is have an affair behind her husband shugoro s tsuiyuki sasaki a toshiyuki sasaki back who happen to be masanori s teacher shugoro unexpect arriv home to find his wife and student have veri intim relat with each other his honour destroy the enrag samurai brutal murder both otami and masanori befor commit suicid over a centuri later and ted fletcher edward albert arriv in japan on a work holiday with his wife laura susan georg and their young daughter ami ami barrett their close friend alex curti doug mcclure who work for the american consul help them out by find them a place to stay you don t need me to you where he joke say it s go so cheap becaus it s haunt to which both ted and laura laugh off a they obvious don t believ in ghost at least for the time be that is almost immedi the film goe into clich mode light turn on and off by themselv laura ha an uneasi feel about the place and a local zen monk henri mitowa give them an omin warn for them to leav befor it s too late which they ignor of cours the spirit of otami masanori and shugoro were doom for etern to remain within the wall of the hous becaus of a majyo witch tsuyako olajima cur put upon them but there may be a way they can break the cur unfortun for the fletcher famili it could potenti cost them their marriag daughter and possibl even their veri live direct by kevin connor i thought this wa a pretti averag film ok to watch onc if you ve got noth better to do but after a day or two you ll probabl have complet forgotten it noth stick in the memori a be particular bad but on the other hand there s noth particular good about the film either the script by robert suhoski from the novel by jame hardiman is a littl on the dull side and strict by the number a lot of ghost go on happen throughout the film but none of it is veri interest or excit and the flat charact and direct doesn t help thing there are coupl of silli sequenc like the giant plastic crab that tri to get ami and her babysitt noriko mayumi umeda and there is a scene where the zen monk exorcis the hous and the ghost are banish outsid unabl to get back in howev that is until ted simpli open the door and they just walk right back in some exorc one more thing i think it wa a bad idea to have doug mcclure who wa when he made this tri his hand at kung fu and orient sword fight georg get her ampl breast out a coupl of time includ a veri unerot sex scene with mcclure although great pain and a coupl of bed sheet that stick to them like super glue were taken to ensur no below the waist nuditi wa present apart from a coupl of most off screen decapit there s no blood gore or violenc to speak about the transpar ghost effect are ok but they ain t go to impress mani peopl these day it s profession enough made and look quit nice but the potenti in the japanes set and myth is squander a this film could have been set in america england or ani western countri without have to chang a thing an ok time waster 
 
 
 
at the begin of the film you might doubl check the dvd cover and re read the synopsi a coupl of time but no worri it s not memoir of a geisha that you purchas just a movi with an intro that is much more classi and stylish than it ha ani right to be still the open is by far the best thing about the entir movi a it show how in the year a samurai sword master catch his wife commit adulteri he decapit the two lover befor do some hara kiri ritual suicid through disembowel cut to present day when the american ambassador in japan welcom a befriend famili and drive them up to the same hous where the aforement slaughter took place near one and a half centuri ago from then onward this becom a seem routin haunt hous flick yet the utter retard and implaus script still make it somewhat except let s start with the good aspect name the origin japanes set and the presenc of the delici susan georg who is my all time favorit british horror wench well togeth with britt eckland linda hayden and ingrid pitt the bad aspect simpli includ that the screenplay is incoher imbecil beyond repair and full of suppos unsettl twist that onli evok laughter the restless spirit of the hous soon begin to entertain themselv by perpetr into the bodi of the new tenant and caus them to do and say all sort of crazi stuff the spirit of the massacr adulter woman particular enjoy squeez into susan s ravish booti and transform her into a lewd seductress in this posse state she even lure the american ambassador outsid to have sex in the garden of a high societi diner parti full of promin guest so strict spoken it s not realli evil that dwell in the hous just a trio of sleazi ghost with dirti mind and far too much free time on their long dead hand obvious these scene are more comic than frighten especi sinc the light blue and transpar shape remind you of the cute ghost effect that were later popular in ghostbust the hous where evil dwell is probabl the least scari ghost movi ever throughout most of the run time you ll be wonder whether director kevin connor who nevertheless made the excel horror film motel hell and from beyond the grave intent want to make his movi funni and over the top like motel hell mayb but then again everyon in the cast continu to speak his her line with a straight and sincer face so i guess we are nevertheless suppos to take everyth serious and feel disturb the hous where evil dwell is never suspens or even remot excit and it doesn t even contain ani grisli imag apart from the massacr at the begin i am fulli awar of how shallow it sound but the two scene in which susan georg goe topless are the onli true highlight well those and mayb also the invas of cheesi and ridicul over size spider or are they crab in the daughter s bedroom how total random and irrelev wa that if you ever decid to give this movi a chanc notwithstand it bad reput make sure you leav your common sen and reason at the doorstep trivia note for horror buff keep an eye open for the demon mask that wa also a pivot piec of sceneri in the brilliant japanes horror classic onibaba 
 
 
 
from read all of the comment post here on imdb this movi seem to get rag on a lot but i didn t think it wa that bad i ve seen much wors actual the hous where evil dwell is a ghost stori about a husband and his wife ted and laura fletcher and their daughter ami who move into an old hous in japan littl do they know a japanes ninja brutal murder his wife and her lover and then kill himself year earlier with a samurai sword a strang thing happen in the hous the ghost of the previous resid begin to posse the bodi of the live and plan on re enact the bloodi murder that took place year back i saw this movi and decid to give it a chanc from the cover it look like a decent ghost stori it wa routin and it wa corni but i ve seen wors in my day the ghost sequenc were a littl over done we get to see the transluc blue tint figur random pop up random around the famili and take over their bodi to be honest the ghost in this movi kind of remind me of the ghost in the haunt mansion ride at disneyland i may be mistaken but after watch this it seem to me that the japanes horror film ju on the grudg and the american remak of that film rip this off a littl the old japanes home where a brutal murder took place ghost activ cur put on the home etc but i may be wrong to sum it up this is a pretti corni ghost stori don t go out of your way to see it but if you like this kind of thing and it happen to come on tv you can give it a shot 
 
 
 
i just rent and watch this movi just to see what s all the fuss about so here s what my reaction to it are it s easili seen that this is a low budget film with poor actor the main plot of this movi is about a woman get reveng on her rapist this concept if done right could easili turn out to be a realli provoc film howev the movi doesn t shock or disturb me at all it just bore me this movi could be easili shorten to under minut all lot of scene are main there to fill in time like those sceneri scene and some scene i describ below contain spoiler i find the rape scene quit tame i don t know if i have watch the cut or uncut version if there is actual such a version i also found mani plot hole within the alreadi bad written plot here s a list on top of my mind whi don t the rapist rape jennif dure the night when she walk out her hous to find out what those nois are that would be an excel time whi don t they just gang rape her instead of delay some of the rapist the pleasur and lengthen jennif s ordeal by such a long time it would probabl be more shock and disturb that way i found it realli stupid that the rapist left her in the forest and head back to her hous mayb to show that these rapist are realli imbecil these rapist should at least know that if you want to do a dirti job right they shouldn t send a coward imbecil to do the job whi didn t jennif call the polic when the rapist final left which should be the first thing that pop up in most peopl s mind especi for someon who is a writer whi didn t these rapist smell danger mile away when they saw jennif is aliv i find it realli amaz that a slender ladi like camill can pull a man up a tree and hang him end spoiler but hey this movi is not without it merit camill keaton is gorgeous and i get to hear one of the funniest line i have recent heard when matthew protest of go back into the hous and kill jennif `whi me whi me i didn t even c^m 
 
 
 
i ve seen the gator bait film and this is almost exact the same thing a those a woman is sexual assault by a group of degener men and systemat exact her vicious reveng on each of them the thing that set this movi apart from those one although not veri far is that the sexual content is not glorifi there is full frontal nuditi mani time throughout the film but not for a second is it ever sexi some of the rape scene might seem a littl extens but that s onli becaus the movi is tri to strengthen the audienc s need to see this woman seek reveng this is a weak film it ha no other way to maintain interest other than manipul our natur desir to see this woman get reveng on her attack i spit on your grave is not the kind of movi that you expect to deliv a serious moral but i wa glad to see that sinc it contain a signific amount of violenc inflict upon the femal lead it wa not meant to pas off a a t a film b movi are notori for be driven by nuditi and out of control adolesc sexual and while i spit on you grave is unmistak a b movi and contain more than it share of nuditi the nuditi doe not drive the plot on the other hand the onli thing that drive the plot is an empti necess for reveng against a group of rapist these men are evolutionari drop out just like they were in the gator bait film and the biggest challeng for the writer seem to have been to come up with new and excit way to kill them but the reason the film can never be anyth more than a meaningless b movi is becaus it doe not deliv a messag of ani kind but instead it simpli satisfi the audienc s desir to see a bunch of rapist get exact what they deserv the one problem that this leav is that we have to sit through the sexual attack odd the first half of the film is the part that contain the most nuditi although not by much but it is by far the most pain to watch we are even let down a littl a we watch the woman obtain reveng sinc a coupl of the death were so elabor that they were obvious imposs it seem like pure luck that the guy in the lake at the end felt such an overwhelm desir to hug the motor on the boat and press his genitalia against the propel stay that way while the woman yell some final word at him and pull the cord but again this movi satisfi onli the desir for reveng that the first half fill u with spoiler you know that this is all the movi mean to do sinc it liter end the minut the last guy is kill the woman doe not live happili ever after she doesn t write her book she doesn t leav and never return to that nightmar place she just get in the boat and motor around the lake while the movi simpli stop in it track but hey what more did you expect oh and did you read the taglin if you decid to wast your time watch this tri and find ani man get broken or burn i wa realli look forward to those 
 
 
 
i m not go to bother with a plot synopsi sinc you know what the movi is about and there s almost no plot anyway i ve seen sever review call isoyg an anti rape film or even a feminist statement and i just have to chime in on the gall hypocrisi of these claim first of all what do we see on the cover of this movi that s right a shape woman s behind whether it wa zarchi s attempt to make an anti rape statement and i absolut don t believ it wa is entir besid the point the film is market sex and the titil of sexual assault and the materi is so graphic everyth but actual penetr is shown that no one but the hard core exploit crowd will enjoy it the rape s in the film is uncomfort brutal and hard to watch there s someth to be said for present a horribl crime in such a brutal light but there wa no reason for this scene to go on for seem minut none there wa also littl charact develop of the victim and onli one of the rapist is slight develop mere moment befor he s murder so the scene isn t at all engag on an emot level realli it s just present for the sake of show extrem sexual violenc and you can tell by the movi isoyg is associ with on imdb caligula cannib ferox etc that it attract onli the exploit crowd final a few review have commend zarchi s so call documentari style and lack of a soundtrack but consid how inept everyth el in the film is act script etc i suspect these were financi decis and the film look like a documentari becaus he liter station a camera and let his porn calib actor do their thing i m not go to get all up on my high hors talk about the content of isoyg i m all for exploit horror and love video nasti in fact i m give this movi three star onli becaus it truli doe push the envelop so much further than some other film howev it s also poor made and after the rape occur just downright bore for the rest of the film a we watch a bunch of ho hum most gore le murder and wait for the credit to roll this is probabl worth watch onc if you re a hardcor s exploit fan but i m tell you the movi is overal pretti bad and not realli worth it notori reput 
 
 
 
be a filmmak myself and posse a somewhat dark and subvers sen of humour i thought i wa in for a treat when i took home my wrong not that the dvd cover give anyth away instead opt for the ambigu quot from controversialist director chris morri a short film includ scene i should have known better realli and avoid this insipid and often offens piec of twoddl the scene in the church is repuls to watch especi sinc we are all too familiar with morri s warp attitud toward paedophilia from his notori tv seri brass eye and serv no purpos other than to shock how this film is label a comedi i will never understand the runner s commentari sound like a novel idea in principl have been a runner myself it s often an interest and uninhibit perspect on the filmmak process howev this is sad not the case here instead we are treat to some public schoolboy rant about dog on film befor conclud that there are no realli great movi star dog this is all veri interest but not worth a singl frame of celluloid to say that this film goe nowher would be an understat it reli far too heavili upon it heighten style at the expens of plot charact and dialogu leav the viewer strang perturb and unfulfil it over simplifi messag that man should take respons for his action is both glare obvious and poor illustr the film doe have it moment of pseudo kafkaesqu surreal but ultim it fail to convinc to entertain to enlighten and just end up be irrit if you want to see a realli great piec of short filmmak i strong recommend franz kafka s it s a wonder life by peter capaldi 
 
 
 
one of the major flaw in this film is that while the mock of pretenti yuppi is satisfi it fail to realiz that the movi maker themselv are guilti of be one of those that deserv to be mock one of the characterist of these yuppi type is the conceit misunderstand that they the yuppi are the onli one sophist enough to understand art while the movi ignor this characterist and instead focus on their misunderstand of din i find it iron that onli peopl who enjoy this movi boast the same conceit tast in film a the charact do in their choic of dinner if these pompous charact that were in this movi have a video librari at home i would bet that american psycho would be one of those movi 
 
 
 
without wish to be a killjoy brad syke is respons for at least two of the most dull and clich d film i ve ever seen this be one of them and camp blood be anoth the act is terribl the print is shoddi and everyth about this film scream serious you could do better yourself mayb this is a challeng to everyon to satur youtub with our own zombi relat crap i bought this for but rememb you can t put a price on minut of your life you d do well to avoid this turkey even at a bargain basement price

i found tremor the legend begin to be dull and bore all the action scene were stupid the so call graboid are reduc to the size of a modern day hous cat if not smaller the act wa horrend and this film wa just an unnecessari movi in the tremor saga becaus even though it tell the stori of how the graboid were form the stori is so dumb and useless also if you want to tell a stori way back in time make sure you use the same actor michael gross to be someon in the past when he s someon in the present in the other tremor movi geez if you haven t seen this film don t wast your time stick to tremor and for a good time this film howev make sure you re remot is sit right next to you with the stop button work for a quick retreat away from this nonsens

ok i know that a lot of peopl will probabl resent this review a watership down is a classic and a standard part of most peopl s childhood but see this film for the first time at the tender age of i must admit i realli hate it we watch this film becaus my sister had read the book and realli enjoy it and mani peopl who whimper at the veri word watership down their memori of see the film a child and have their emot torn at the seam recommend it to be honest i wish i hadn t bother i gave it the benefit of the doubt general i don t like to stop watch a film half way through this wa an except it wa realli realli excruci sicken dull this film wa possibl the slowest thing i ve ever watch imagin a dope up snail in space and realli didn t do it for me the art wa alright the background were nice made if not a littl bland and twee yet the rabbit themselv were not veri endear and the anim wa quit jumpi and poor produc i m not go to go into huge detail about the storylin basic it is the tale of a group of rabbit who leav their warren due to the infiltr of human in the area general a moralist stori about the peril of human interact on the environ it use anthropomorph rabbit to put the messag across for me i kind of wish that they would get gas not becaus i m a horribl sadist person but becaus the charact were uninspir annoy dull and general quit rude oh i m so terribl english i found that i wa constant look at the clock whilst watch the film and it took a whole minut or so befor anyth actual happen and even that wa a terribl anticlimax if i were to prais it in ani way i d have to admit that the concept of show child the peril of build on the countrysid and hope unveil the arrog of human etc etc is quit well mean mayb it is all in general sanctimoni and preachi but the messag it s tri to put forth is good in it natur the music score wa not bad too so to conclud this film is pretti poor i couldn t watch it the whole way through or i d probabl be forc to eat my own leg in sheer boredom grant it isn t torqu bad but it still doesn t rate high in my eye so i ve given it a hope this help

so it s realli sexist and classist and i thought that it might not be in the begin stage of the movi like when stella tell steven that she would realli like to chang herself and begin speak in the right way and he tell her not to chang well he certain chang his tune and it seem that the other review follow suit what at the begin appear to be a love stori is realli about social placement and woman a sacrifici mother the end of the movi doe not make her a hero it make the whole thing sad and it sad that peopl think it make her a hero perhap that is the comment of the movi that peopl should take away posit recept reflect continu patriarch current in the social conscienc yuck 
 
 
 
i should love this movi the act is veri good and barbara stanwyck is great but the the movi ha alway seem veri trite to me the movi make work class peopl look low and cheap the fact that the daughter is asham of her mother and that the daughter doe not rise abov it ha alway made me a bit uneasi barbara stanwyck a the mother worship the daughter but the daughter forgo a mother love to find happi with her well to do father famili i wonder how mani other who have seen this film feel this way about it again the act wa veri veri good and worth watch i realli don t like the stori line just a person prefer thank you
 
 
 
the first half wa ok but the last half realli realli disappoint it s funni the produc even admit they didn t have a clue for the end and it realli show what realli sad is i have to write ten line of comment minimum to be abl to post this i realli didn t want to includ spoiler to qualifi my remark sinc the show isn t realli worth that effort when battlestar galatica first came out i wa realli excit with the prospect of a better remak it didn t happen that first season border on be space porn they eventu clean it up a bit and actual had some pretti fair drama so i start watch again but to end the seri with kara be a cyclon god angel same with baltar and six wa pretti dumb 
 
 
 
there are mani good thing about the new bsg there s the multipl cylon role for model and for exampl which the two actress play superbl there s the old school feel of industri design aboard galactica my ship will not be network over my dead bodi also all the space battl the special effect even though the season sci fi watcher will acknowledg the cartoonish of it all the dark of the charact their essenti flaw natur that make it all the more bitter that the end wa so childish yes the first part the scene in space the raid on the cylon and all that wa veri good but the mushi end i alway watch film and show these day with the timer hidden so i never know how much time is left until the end so for me it wa a special kind of tortur to see the end happen over and over again everi time i thought oh this is the final scene the final shot i got one more everi frakk charact got it complet end that wasn t realli necessari what realli highlight the schoolboy amateurish of it all the young roslin scene whi is import for u to know that a she lost her sister and father in a horribl accid and b that she ha a one night stand with a former pupil student what doe that bring to the stori where wa the linkag now i m all for a more european ish style approach and a random act of whatev in film and show and all that but this wa just ridicul this didn t bring anyth meaning to the stori also i ve seen the last frakkin special and in it ron reveal his own clueless about the plot he couldn t come up with a good end for the stori so he just didn t it s never a much about the charact a they made the last episod to be the whole this wa thousand of year in the past idea the mitochondri eve thing wa also use in the hitchhik guid to the galaxi and believ you me there are a lot of bsg watcher who know that particular h g storylin and speak of hera now there s a storylin that wa not work out well at all instead we get roslin is do her former pupil who s year younger don t get me wrong i m all for older woman with younger men the more power to them but this just made no sen all in all the write in this seri is a flaw a they intend it charact would be that goe even moreso for the last episod i hope lost and do better with their seri final 
 
 
 
horribl end and i can t believ moor spent a year come up with it smack of l ron hubbard and dianetitc which hubbard claim to pen in just three week this wa actual disappoint enough for me to toss my disc from the first year now the first hour were action pack though absurd in the premis and then it deterior into a slow pain sophomor dissolut of the seri unbeliev how slow and drawn out that last hour wa were we to think more deepli if i want a lesson in a materi i would reread daniel quinn s ishmael absurd to think k peopl would give up everyth for a fresh start absurd to throw in a disappear kara and a reappear baltar and six absurd to throw in the mitochondri eve just absurd 
 
 
 
did i step in someth or is that bad smell come from daybreak god wa behind everyth what ha god got to do with sci fi god is onli the answer when you can t think up a sensibl explan for someth in fact this is exact the problem with the seri final they obvious couldn t think up sensibl explan for the multitud of big question that were rais throughout the seri such a how kara thrace come back from the dead in a brand new viper how her old viper and char bodi end up on earth whi baltar ha an imaginari in his head whi ha an imaginari baltar in her head etc so they explain it with angel or just don t explain it at all the plot of the last episod had hole big enough to fli a basestar through for exampl whi doe galactica and it crew go on a suicid mission to rescu one girl hera particular after adama said there wa no way he d attempt a rescu becaus they found out the locat of the cylon base that s not a good reason to sacrific the crew s live and how did ander know the locat and what wa the point of the flashback to the major charact live befor the war it s like they forgot to do it earlier so they threw someth in at the last moment the peopl who wrote the last two episod could not have been the same writer who creat what ha been so far a sensat seri feel like the script write wa take over by evangel christian on a mission to spread the word forget tri to tie up the loo end in the plot the import messag the writer want to get across is don t put your faith in technolog a it will lead to your destruct god is your ultim salvat tough luck if you have an ill that need medic treatment imagin in the final movi of the star war seri they tell you there is no forc instead a jedi actual get his power from jesus then they fli their spaceship into the nearest star and go live in the forest with the ewok would this be a good end no it frakken wouldn t 
 
 
 
the s saw a vogu for documentari film about remot corner of the world with an emphasi on wild anim exot terrain and primit peopl with unusu cultur despit the logist of transport a film crew to a distant and danger place and then bring em back aliv with the film footag such film were often much cheaper to make than were convent hollywood featur becaus there were no expens set costum or high price movi star the most success maker of such film artist and financi were the team of martin e johnson and his wife osa who made sever documentari sometim with blatant stage event in africa and asia the johnson safari film were extrem popular inspir sever parodi most notabl wheeler woolsey s so this is africa in which the veri sexi esther muir play a charact name mr johnson martini instead of martin e johnson geddit although sever other filmmak were produc safari documentari at this time the johnson film were the most popular in this genr becaus they reli heavili on humour view from our own more enlighten i hope standpoint this is a serious flaw in the johnson documentari there are too mani scene in which the funni littl brown or yellow peopl are made to look complet idiot who are easili outsmart by the clever white bwana johnson and his wife one definit asset of these movi is the presenc of osa johnson ten year younger than her husband she manag to seem young enough to be his daughter while certain not a attract a the shape blond esther muir osa johnson wa a pert brunett who gave ingrati perform in front of the camera in all the film she co produc with her husband congorilla is probabl the best of the johnson film the shot of the congo are interest and have some histor valu a evid of what this environ look like in the shot of the pygmi and other nativ are also interest although these suffer from the johnson penchant to stage event in a manner that make the nativ look wild and alien the best and funniest scene in congorilla is an improvis sequenc in which osa johnson attempt to teach a jazz danc to some pygmi woman the danc is the black bottom no le the same danc which bob hope famous taught to daisi and violet hilton the conjoin twin wear jodhpur ride boot and a pith helmet osa johnson start scat sing while she doe high step and slap her knee in her attempt to teach this danc to the african woman meanwhil they just stand there stare at her appar wonder what this crazi white woman is tri to accomplish it s a veri funni scene but it ha unpleas underton osa johnson is do a danc that wa invent by black american the implic seem to be that black african should instinct be abl to perform this danc after a brief demonstr use natur rhythm i guess becaus it s in their blood or someth i ll rate congorilla point out of this film say a littl bit about african life in the s and rather more about american cultur percept in that same decad 
 
 
 
the movi suck it wasn t funni it wasn t excit they tri to make it so bad that it would be good but fail and think it s cool to like this movi next to the hype are the onli reason that this movi is a success the fact that at this moment vote a out of for this movi seem pretti concern to me either the movi go public is go insan or this vote is unrealist which can have numer caus and should be dealt with anyway it is a le than averag movi which bloom through mouth to mouth advertis it s success can onli be describ a a market marvel

when discus a movi titl snake on a plane we should point out earli that the snake are pretti darn import to the plot what we have here are veri bad cgi snake that neither look nor move like real snake snake are scari becaus they appear to be slimi they crawl they slither these snake do noth of the sort they glide along like they would in a video game they are cartoon snake i would go a far to say that even someon that had a major phobia against real snake would not find these one scari whi on earth then would you want to includ extrem close up of these cgi failur whi not reli on suspens the whole le is more ethic or better still whi not just make them look good in the first place and then mayb still use them spare take one look at john carpent the thing here we have real slime and gore of eeri proport year go by and we get this pile of stink sfx crap snake on a plane when are these peopl go to wake up and smell the coffe special effect are go backward sure you could say but the movi is a joke get it sure i m with that idea but do it well in addit to the abov this movi ha crap dialogu and the music and sound effect are not creepi or memor in ani way i could handl everi other actor be part of this movi except for jackson what wa he do there the man who star in pulp fiction year ago is this career progress are you offer peopl valu for money no i d like to know what tarantino thought when he wa half way through this stinker of a movi the current generat seem to have veri low expect and hollywood seem to be offer them just what they want on leav the cinema i saw a number of advertis for some truli horrend look futur releas includ doa dead or aliv anoth cgi anim film call flush away and anoth crap look comedi name click in addit to that i saw some aw trailer includ one for anoth crap british horror comedi i ve truli not seen the movi industri in a mess like this for a long time expect to see this movi for sale in the dvd bargain section for in month time and if you re expect to see a black comedi with tonn of great look snake and some bad as cool dialogu come from samuel l jackson lip forget it 
 
 
 
this film had so much promis i wa veri excit about this film in the end it wa laughabl at best pain at worst the act style ran the gamut from realli realli flat the angel the wife and daughter to over anim casper s charact i felt that the dialogu wa just an attempt to transfer inform to the audienc instead of real peopl tri to talk to each other pay special attent to the scene regard the bug it s pretti much an insult to the audienc s abil to figur thing out in defens of that scene though it got the biggest laugh of the whole movi i had read that they spent alot of money travel to various oversea locat too bad they didn t make use of it i didn t feel like i wa transport to exot locat anybodi could insert stock footag of the coliseum in rome howev to end on a posit note i thought the set were pretti good i realli like the graphic that were display on the decod comput it is my opinion and that s all it is that if the schmaltz factor would have been much much lower and the action factor would have been great increas this film would have been good 
 
 
 
yes i admit i cri dure this movi it wa so incred disappoint that i couldn t help myself but cri tbn triniti broadcast network ha done it again first with have the million dollar man ex profession wrestler on their program and now this the omega code follow a stream of sketchi religi orient movi it wa quit amus yet at the same time it wa disturb to find it so biblic inaccur the movi follow what is known a the bibl code rather than follow actual biblic scriptur this film is extrem poor made from it write to it direct to it hilari horribl act it depress that peopl actual put effort into this movi it appear more like a late night movi someon would watch on the usa channel or a straight to home video rather than a theatric releas movi i high recommend you do not watch this movi even if your life depend on it 
 
 
 
 this movi bask too much in it own innoc it doesn t tell a stori it s more a big time snooz fest while the actor are all person the stori is so trite and goe nowher i think victor rasuk ha great charisma but deserv a real film from a real storytel 
 
 
 
quit honest the omega code is the worst movi i have seen in a veri long time dure the first minut i sat stun in my seat tri to decid if i should demand a refund but sinc i hadn t paid to see it in the first place pas i figur i might a well stay and i didn t think it could possibl get ani wors it did i will quick run through the low point includ some spoiler the horribl miscast of casper van dien a gillen lane a motiv speaker with two phd the character wa inconsist for exampl lane despit his credenti is a complet nitwit then there s the lame o depict of the fulfil of the biblic propheci we see a bunch of sensat news soundbit accompani by ridicul comput print out of the translat biblic code also terribl action sequenc lane escap from tough situat without explan and the one time lane actual doe seem to be in danger it turn out to be a dream sequenc that s cute for grammar school write assign but it s an inexcus plot devic in a motion pictur the pace wa bad after a long open the first third of the movi chang scene everi second later the pace improv but there is still far too much unnecessari jump around and a someon el mention year pas yet no one not even lane s young daughter age that wa disconcert there are a few good thing though the qualiti of the film e g lack of graini is high and veri attract the outdoor shot were well done and the locat shoot ad a touch of realism also there are a few moment in the last part of the film when lane call on god final to help him this prove to be quit exhilar even to me someon who doe not accept jesus a a person savior but i like this becaus it struck me a be the onli genuin scene in the movi unfortun it wa follow by major incomprehens the charact dialogu direct and act were all poor done michael ironsid had noth to do and michael york wa just weird i think the produc want to do too much if the plot had been tighter and more focus and the character more flesh out the film would have been far better in a nutshel the omega code disappoint definit do not pay to see this i give it out of ten star 
 
 
 
i m a christian i have alway been skeptic about movi made by christian howev a a rule they are know noth when it come to movi product i admir tbn for tri to present god and jesus in a posit and honest way on the screen howev they did a hideous job of it the act wa horribl and unless one is familiar with the bibl in some fashion one could not have understood what the movi wa tri to get across not onli wa the movi terribl made but the peopl who made it even had some fact wrong howev in this critiqu those fact are irrelev and too deep to delv into in short the omega code is the absolut worst movi i have ever seen and i would not recommend it to anyon except for comic relief from the everi day grind 
 
 
 
i sincer consid this movi a anoth poor effort of dominican movi industri the first minut of the movi are a littl funni but then when they switch their role in the societi men do what woman usual do and woman do what men usual do the movi fall becom bore and not funni at all they let mani thing without explan and the end of the movi is predict i didn t like the way a a roberto angel play his charact and his littl either i went to the movi theater hope to see a good work but i went out realli disappoint i don t recommend this movi 
 
 
 
someon will have to explain to me whi everi film that featur poor peopl and adopt a pseudo gritti look is somehow seen a realist by some peopl i didn t see anyth realist about the charact although the actor did their best with realli bad part or the situat instead i saw a forc self conscious effort at be edgi gritti and down and dirti sad it take a lot more than hand hold the camera without rhyme or reason and fail to light the film to achiev ani of the abov qualiti in ani signific way it s a sad commentari on the state of independ film distribut that the onli film that see the insid of a movi theater are nowaday all carbon copi with bad cinematographi non exist camera direct and a lot of swear strive to pas themselv a art it s littl wonder that film like in the bedroom or about schmidt get such rave i found them to be meander and veri averag but compar to the current slew of independ clone like rais victor varga they are outright brilliant and inspir a few year ago see an independ film meant that you would like be treat to some origin and a lot of energi and care and mayb a few technic glitch caus by the low budget nowaday it mean that chanc are you ll get yet anoth by the number let s shake the camera around for two hour attempt at placat the lack of tast of independ distributor and of cours all that to serv charact and situat that are complet unreal and contriv is it ani surpris that the independ marketplac ha fewer and fewer surviv compani not at all when you see film like rais victor varga that do noth but copi the worst of the film that preced them 
 
 
 
it ha a great name but that it and you wont get more than that for your money in fact the first min of the movi you might find it some kind of funni but after that the stori goe from one side to anoth with no particular reason and you just cant understand what happen until the action it gone and yet the produc roberto angel salcedo call him an actor but i don t think the way he doe could be call noth but overact period the littl kid who play a his son ha total no sen of act and i believ it wa just a favor he did or someth becaus he had no clue of what he wa do for some reason while do the cast they thought that by cast comedian they could made it but they didn t and sometim the tasteless cheap humor it so bad i don t buy it but hope this is a bad a it get to make peopl accept those dvd s to the good tast public they will have to offer some food with it that might work out maka
 
 
 
be an elvi fan i can t understand how this proyect could be done is by far the worst elvi relat movi of all time total unfunni silli and plenti of mistak about the king come on elvi grave in a public park a mention about suspici mind in and these are just two exampl some peopl in the cast tri to do their best mike starr is funni special a an imperson the tom hank cameo is a surpris but the guy play the young elvi suck overal the movi lack fun and becom more bore minut after minut if you want to see an ultra cheap insan but absolut funni littl film relat to elvi i truli recommend you bubba ho tep instead of this mess 
 
 
 
dark comic serendip about a cosmet saleswoman with odd tie to elvi presley run into a sea of elvi imperson while speak at convent in nevada and accident kill each one of them through littl fault of her own kim basing a still attract actress of consider merit like to pick quirki movi to play in but this dread screenplay by mitchel ganem and adam michael garber hasn t an iota of good humor the stereotyp and low ball gag are not meant to be the stuff of classic comedi but even on a shambl shame level the pictur is crude and sloppi if you do watch see if you can count how much extran shot there are of basing behind the wheel of her pink cadillac hand alway in the same posit and a non plus look on her face hope both she and elvi were well paid no star from 
 
 
 
i have absolut no knowledg of author phillipa pearc or ani of her novel and if tom` midnight garden is typic of her work i probabl would have had littl interest in her book a a child when i wa a child i wasn`t realli interest in litretur unless it had soldier fight monster complet with a high bodi count judg by this film version of tom` midnight garden i guess pearc write for lower middl class kid sinc much of the stori of revolv around protagonist tom long move to a hous with no garden then sudden find a metaphys one have a garden of your own wa no doubt someth that work class peopl didn`t have in the s so i guess there` some polit class ridden subtext there somewher there` also a romanc involv a young girl call hatti but again are cynic kid amour by love stori perhap the worst critic is that veri littl in the way of excit or adventur happen within the narrat this is a child film that seem date by it sourc it` inoffens but i`m surpris by it high rate by the imdb voter i wonder how mani of them would have given it so mani high mark if they were year old who`d just seen the lord of the ring trilog 
 
 
 
rais victor varga a review you know rais victor varga is like stick your hand into a big steam bowl of oatmeal it s warm and gooey but you re not sure if it feel right tri a i might no matter how warm and gooey rais victor varga becam i wa alway awar that someth didn t quit feel right victor varga suffer from a certain overconfid on the director s part appar the director thought that the ethnic backdrop of a latino famili on the lower east side and an idyl storylin would make the film critic proof he wa right but it didn t fool me rais victor varga is the stori about a seventeen year old boy call you guess it victor varga victor rasuk who live his teenag year chase more skirt than the roll stone could do in all the year they ve tour the movi start off in `ug fat donna s bedroom where victor is sure to seduc her but a cri from outsid disrupt his plan when his best friend harold kevin rivera come a look for him caught in the attempt by harold and his sister victor varga run off for damag control yet even with the embarrass implic that he s been bof the homeliest girl in the neighborhood noth dissuad young victor from go off on the hunt for more fresh meat on a hot new york citi day they make way to the local public swim pool where victor s eye catch a glimps of the love young nymph judi judi mart who s not just pretti but a strong and independ too the relationship that develop between victor and judi becom the focus of the film the stori also focus on victor s famili that is compris of his grandmoth or abuelita altagracia guzman his brother nino also play by real life brother to victor silvestr rasuk and his sister vicki krystal rodriguez the action follow victor between scene with judi and scene with his famili victor tri to cope with be an oversex pimp daddi his feel for judi and his grandmoth s conserv cathol upbring the problem that aris from rais victor varga are a few but glare error throughout the film you get to know certain charact like vicki nino grandma judi and even judi s best friend meloni the problem is we know noth of victor varga except that he is the biggest gigolo in the neighborhood we know that he know how to lick his lip and comb his fro and carri himself for the sake of woo girl into the sack but that s all we know that nino play piano and quiet well you could see it by the award on the famili piano we know his sister nicki is a gossip love girl with an invest interest in watch tv we know that grandma is a hard work tradit latina woman who s tri to rais her kid with conserv in a world of excess corrupt yet where is the titular charact victor varga he s in this movi somewher but we onli know what the movi tell u this is by far the film s biggest flaw victor varga isn t so much a charact but a ping pong ball bounc between scene with judi and his grandmoth but we never get to know who victor varga realli is this is import becaus a i ve mention the onli thing we know of victor varga is that he s a sexual activ teenag with a libido the size of manhattan he s a total alpha male victor varga is not the kind of charact i sympath with at all whi should anyon so by the end of the movi in the aftermath of the climax are we truli led to believ that somehow victor varga ha attain ani depth and learn the error of his way how could such a two dimension charact have ani depth if onli the director had worri a littl more about flesh out his main charact instead of worri about get that perfect hand held shot rais victor varga bring to life the world of the latino inner citi neighborhood to the big screen someth that few film have done befor in the past the film ha been compliment for feel so real and i won t argu with that i haven t seen this level of realiti sinc cbs air survivor serious although the movi ha some nice shot of the citi the writer director peter sollett wa way too depend on close up and hand held shot this problem is particular notic in indoor scene that are so claustrophob i wa forc to perform deep breath exercis to keep from pas out a the film continu the shot get tighter and tighter with face crop from brow to chin on the screen you can practic smell victor varga s cheap cologn the overal effect is unrealist in contrast the indoor scene of inner citi apart make them look small and cramp which is not true i ve been in those type apart i use to live in one they re not splendor but they have high ceil and they re decent live space by the movi s standard you d think that these apart were x cell of brick and mortar chip paint and crack wall unfortun sollett s constant use of close up and one particular bad shot with a zoom in on one scene come off a total amateurish but rais victor varga is onli sollett s second film and his most well known a solid effort in filmmak that will hope get better a he continu to make film one review i read summar the movi a `ethnic for ethnic s sake and i cannot agre more if victor varga were truli a great film and stori then the charact applic wouldn t matter whether they were latino chine etc yet if you were to take this stori and stick it in middl class suburbia with a bunch of teeni bopper white kid the result wouldn t be such glow review and we d see the film s flaw more clear inde some other aspect of the use of latino in this film bother me while some aspect of victor varga are accur other i have to question for exampl victor nino and vicki all share the same room to sleep this set off an alarm for me becaus it seem contrari to what i believ ani self respect latino famili wouldn t have two older brother share the same room with a thirteen year old girl at first i wa unsur perhap i wa wrong but after speak with my grandmoth i knew my problem with this wa justifi consid how conserv the grandmoth is you d think that vicki would have been sleep in her room a a latino who grew up in a somewhat conserv cuban household rais by my grandmoth while my mother wa work full time i could relat to the movi in mani way which is whi my critic viewpoint are bittersweet becaus i realli want to love this movi unfortun my lack of respect for victor varga sabotag my feel for the film mayb it s becaus victor varga remind me of those guy who were get laid while i wa play with my sega genesi when i wa seventeen mayb it s becaus without ani further introspect by the film victor varga is mere a stereotyp hot blood latino who ll just end up shout to girl from his car `hey bay bee ju want to get into my luv mah cheen either way i don t like him so ultim how can i like a film about him so if you ll excus me i m go to go stick my hand into a bowl of grit 
 
 
 
i think the croc hunter is a pretti cool guy i know i wouldn t have the nerv to go even foot away from a croc but everyth in this movi is bad fart joke peopl get eaten and the skit about the presid all make the movi one of the worst of all time it s a realli bad film that you have to stay away from all the joke are so juvenil that you will find yourself laugh becaus they are so stupid the plot is so bad that you wonder if the screenwrit is year old i m surpris the croc hunter did not beg the crocodil to eat him after he saw this

i never wa an avid viewer of crocodil hunter but did occasion see an episod or a bit of an episod and when the news spread about steve irwin s death from a stingray attack in it certain caught my attent this movi with steve and his wife terri play themselv but in a fiction stori wa releas in but i didn t hear of it until sever year later and even after that it took me a while to get around to see it well now i have seen it and after look here first more than onc and see it rate i wa not surpris at how unimpress it turn out to be though it could have been a bit better appar it s suppos to be a comedi so a major problem with it is that it isn t veri funni at all a u s satellit beacon fall down from space and land in australia where it is swallow by a crocodil while steve and terri irwin are on a mission to captur this crocodil from a place where it terror the cattl on a ranch own by the crazi brozzi drewitt and are unawar of what s insid it two cia agent are sent to australia to retriev the beacon the agent are assist by jo buckley and the ranch owner and her dog might make the mission more difficult for them on steve and terri s mission they face other type of danger wildlif not just the crocodil and sinc they have no clue that the croc ha anyth unusu insid it when steve see the cia agent after them he mistak them for poacher not onli did i not laugh onc while watch this film the onli part that realli made me smile wa steve irwin use a big snake to scare off one of the cia agent apart from that i don t think i found anyth even mild amus it s also a bit of an incoher mess switch back and forth from the australian outback to the cia headquart and it seem like clip from crocodil hunter and clip from an action thriller or someth like that put togeth for some reason also ad to that mix are the ranch scene which also seem to be from somewher el and a funni a brozzi drewitt play by magda szubanski is suppos to be she s not at one point we see her fart so we have a fart joke a major clich in modern comedi are they so hard to resist i also found the typic crocodil hunter scene with steve wrestl crocodil and hold other danger creatur and talk about them to viewer to be tedious but i guess the fact that i wa never a devout fan of the show didn t help steve irwin wa admir by mani a a conservationist and is sad miss by them while there are also those who say he mess with natur and had it come to him no matter which side you re on the crocodil hunter collis cours is not a well craft movi i m sure it doe help if you re a big steve irwin fan but even if you are there s no guarante that you would like this movi a some fan clear haven t been impress in fact it seem that some of them have found this movi to be wors than i have so mayb it won t help like i said there s no guarante i would say whatev you may think of steve irwin and his show this movi wa unnecessari the attempt to combin what is usual seen in crocodil hunter with a fiction stori unfortun fail and a viewer may find that this film seem longer than nineti minut

this film actual work from a fair origin idea i ve never seen nymph that were thrown out of heaven in a horror movi befor anyway howev the way that it execut this idea isn t origin in the slightest we follow a bunch of kid that for some reason decid to go on a trip into the forest the fact that the forest is inhabit by these nymph make it more interest than mere anoth forest fill by redneck nutcas zombi etc but realli the monster are just a variat on the common horror in the wood theme mani film of this ilk don t have a singl good idea and it would seem that this one ha worn it brain cell out with just that one the onli real asset that the monster bring to the tabl is the fact that they re beauti woman that the charact lust for rather than be hideous grotesqu that they want to run away from this is good up until a point but it soon get bore and the almost complet lack of ani back stori surround the central monster ensur that the film is never go get itself out of the horror trash categori it s been year sinc the evil dead made the woodland a prime horror locat and in spite of film like the blair witch project it still make for an excel horror set this is one of the film s major asset a the forest present a good impress of the unknown the onli problem is that forest of the damn doesn t ever seem to have much up it sleev the death sequenc show a distinct lack of imagin and the fact that all the charact are clich d in the extrem doesn t help a you re more like to be look forward to see them get kill rather than hope they can get away the cast is made up of kid main but there is a role here for tom savini who unfortun doesn t get to have fun in the special effect depart the onli real highlight the film ha where personnel are concern come from the nymph themselv the nake ladi tend to look great and if it wasn t for them this film would get veri bore veri quick there s noth to recommend this film for realli but if you want a daft littl horror film that hark back to the style of eighti woodland flick you might find some enjoy here 
 
 
 
for the first forti minut empir realli shape itself up it appear to be a strong confid and relat unknown gangster flick at the time i didn t know whi i thought it wa good but now i do one of the main problem with this film is that it is pure and utter distast i don t mind film with psycho and thing to prove a point take jacki brown for exampl but they re all so terribl shallow in this but that is obvious thrown in for entertain you liter feel a knot pull in your stomach anoth major problem is the protagonist he is smug arrog yet iron enough not that bad he doesn t seem tight enough to be a drug deal woman killer the fact is at the end of the day this film is complet pretenti not slick not clever just dull and meaningless this coloss mess should be avoid at all cost out of out of

this version move a littl slow for my tast and i suppos i have problem with this play to begin with but first the movi it s a typic tv movi version of a play which mean it doesn t have the flair of the origin film version with william holden what they couldn t afford to hire more than twelv peopl a extra whi move the movi up to so you could give the littl sister a line about the vietnam war protest whi not and give her a line about the civil right movement a for the cast some hit some miss jay o sander hit the right note for his charact especi with his scene with josh brolin brolin on the other hand miss a lot of the note he s believ a an ex bmoc jock but he doesn t have the raw sensual of william holden i alway thought brolin look a littl bit like a gorilla to have all the woman in town go ape over him pardon the pun gretchen moll wa love but she seem a littl too wise for the charact she play she didn t project the innoc or ignor that the charact requir mayb it s becaus she and brolin were about year older than the charact should be but then again holden wa ten year too old bonni bedelia wa rather forgett a the mother and mari steenburgen can t seem to make up her mind whether she wa play blanch duboi or katharin from the tame of the shrew a for mr ing s play i alway felt that stori like this of a young woman choos passion over practic alway need an epilogu the twilight zone i believ offer a like epilogu with the episod spur of the moment where a young diana hyland wa be chase by a bitter older diana hyland becaus the younger diana hyland chose to run off with a guy similar to hal carter

we open with colonel luc deveraux van damm the origin univers soldier and his buxom asian friend be chase down a river by what appear to be univers soldier they almost kill the two then oh wait it wa just a field test deveraux we come to find is now part of a govern fund compani that design the new level of univers soldier whi he would want to be involv in this if you know anyth about the origin is never explain and well beyond me it s after this flimsi set piec that the real stori get go the unit state govern ha cut the univers soldier s project budget and in the process anger seth the larg artifici mainfram comput that control the univers soldier natur he won t be shut down without a fight so that mean van damm ha to go around and take all the new breed of univers soldier out which sound like a fun idea for an action movi and a take on a sequel but that doesn t stop it from becom stupid a hell for instanc one of the new univers soldier is play by bill goldberg seem you can t go wrong cast a wrestler in an action movi he s big he s tough right wrong van damm doesn t seem to have a problem wipe the floor with him onc twice three time the point here lost on me then there s the break of glass a rudimentari part of ani action movi but someon involv must have a glass fetish you have to see the fight scene in particular let s not talk about how nobodi cut themselv or at the veri least slip then to put the cherri on top of this train wreck they have seth the comput secur a human bodi for himself and how appropri it is when they make the villain black michael jai white noth work better than a white good guy fight a black bad guy it would seem potenti offens and just downright lame he s no replac for dolph either univers soldier is a lousi sequel it s loud it s dumb and it doesn t care the origin wasn t anyth poetic but it made a simpl sort of sen with a scienc fiction element and it entertain on a basic level the sequel doesn t they do howev keep the run time under nineti minut and somehow found a way to squeez in a strip club sequenc so give credit where credit is due

this is the offici sequel to the sci fi action thriller in the origin van damm wa among sever dead vietnam war vet reviv to be the perfect soldier unisol in this one it s i guess about a dozen year later sinc van damm ha a daughter about that age now he s work with the govern in a classifi instal to train the latest unisol codenam unisol for some reason a usual someth goe wrong the on site super comput name seth like the snake in king cobra the same year goe power crazi take command of the unisol and even download it comput brain into a new super unisol bodi jai white we re lookin at the next step in evolut folk most of van damm s fight are with one particular mean unisol pro wrestler goldberg who just keep on comin drop him off a build no good run him down with a truck no go shoot him burn him forgetaboutit much of the humor is trace to how van damm is now outmod and out class he s even go grey around the edg but though he take a lickin he keep on kickin most sequel of this sort are pretti lame pale imit of the origin and while this one is certain no stroke of genius it manag to be consist entertain especi if you re a pro wrestl fan 
 
 
 
this movi is most crap and the onli reason this movi is worth watch is becaus jean claud vam damm star in this movi there are some good action scene in this movi and the best one are at the end of the movi the act in this movi is so bad and it the worst act i have ever seen and the actor bill goldberg and michael jai white can not act at all and this movi by far ha to be one of jean claud vam damm worst movi he ha done and if u what to watch him in one of his great movi u should watch blood sport kickbox or sudden death over all this movi is crap ok and my rate is out of 
 
 
 
this wa an atroci wast of my time no plot the act wa so far below par it should be use a an exemplar in act class of what not to do it is mere a commerci rip off of the earlier univers soldier which also scrape the bottom of the act barrel it sad that vd need to assert his ego everi few year and sadder still that peopl will pay good money to sit thru it this kind of schlock give martial art movi a bad name by comparison it make segal norri and arnold look almost talent perhap vd should take the lesli nielson track and do send up of his genr at least then we could be laugh with him instead of at him 
 
 
 
after see the low budget shittier version of the univers soldier franchis i hope and pray that van damm repris his role a luc devoreaux in a second unisol movi well it seem this prayer wa answer but not the way i hope universi soldier is just intens a poetri read at your local librari no even that would be more intrigu the fight sequenc are top notch bruce lee qualiti which is the onli redeem factor in this entir pathet excus for a motion pictur that and have former wcw tough guy legend goldberg play the villain howev place goldberg a seth s sidekick lieuten would ve been better we offend me the most wa the set of the movi itself it s like some film school student slap it togeth the plot hole are that bigger than kany west s ego is what realli did this movi in for exampl luc s daughter hillari look like she s at least year old and the first movi wa film onli seven year ago how is that possibl tell me that the part in which luc s partner wa kill off and turn into a unisol is just re goddamn dicul you mean to tell me that there wa an experiment unisol expo nake in the basement of the research complex at the begin of the movi c mon the director could ve spent more time with this movi like the first one and sewn all the plot hole shut but oooh nooo speak of the plot it suck compar to the first movi univers soldier s plot water down and worthless where s the gritti thrill in which a unisol goe berserk an re enact his last memori in a supermarket rampag think it desert storm or someth this wa the dawn of the millennium you would attract more of an audienc if this had taken place in a dystopia orwellian type of futur cesspit corni is the correct adject to describ this sad sad sad sequel from what i seen doubl impact under sieg robocop and hell even the cheap as no class termin knock off class of is more entertain than this 
 
 
 
i don t think ani movi of van damm s will ever beat univers soldier but u never know this movi wa good but not a good a st vd return a luc must do battl again he tri b funni here but it mayb worth a smirk of a chuckl vd ha a kid this time from alli w good it show a pic of them goldberg wa cool he doe his famous move forgot what it call caus i don t watch wrestl suck vd goldberg had some good fight it wa the end like the st but just not that good vd doe his best move in his career like alway the helicopt kick even though the final end should ve been longer anyway it is worth see but it will never top the origin 
 
 
 
dire just dire the script is contriv the act pain and the stori just drag along it is without a doubt a celebr of salli potter and littl el this wouldn t be so bad but she s the director writer and star of the film and so is just self glorif i found myself not care about the develop romanc between the princip two charact and the end came not a moment too soon it ha two redeem featur first is that a lot of the shot are realli quit love particular in pari and look rather good in black and white second whether you re a fan of tango or not the music is by and larg excel except where salli start sing watch this film at your own risk or if you need an unintent laugh i am sure it appeal to someon statist it ha to 
 
 
 
probabl encourag by admir of her much better orlando potter here deliv a vehicl for herself in the worst way she write direct star and actual co write the music includ a mawkish love song the film strong resembl a high school or colleg project by a teenag convinc that her own intim love and melodramat ob are a fascin to u a to her but potter s charact is a unsympathet a the object of her romant ob is unlik and the whole film is an embarrass display of narciss masquerad a a celebr of the tango perhap if she hadn t cast herself it might have work she just can t act whether play herself or not pretenti over ambiti dull and silli 
 
 
 
the film is sever aw and is demean to rape victim on the surfac it may be a dare film about rape but if you dig beneath the surfac what lie is a not so posit messag about rape aishwarya the rape victim is shown to be a helpless victim who cannot cope all becaus she is a woman she need a man to help her when the societi make jibe about her and throw comment at her she doe not stand up for herself it is all left to anil kapoor to do all the talk while aishwarya doe all the cri the director satish kaushik went down the wrong path by portray a rape victim a weak and submiss what would have been more effect is portray a strong woman who rebel against her enemi in a courag way the director is famous for be chauvinist his film are usual full of weak woman but he tri to hide them in controversi role he need to learn that just becaus the role is controversi it doe not mean that the charact herself is strong the most degrad scene in the film is when aishwarya clean herself after just be rape she doe it to plea her father who think that she is now dirti though it is commend that shah show the stigma against rape victim in such a stark light what he doe not show u is whether ash s father wa wrong for make his daughter do such a thing thus we are left with a confus messag about rape the comedi too is not need in a strong subject film like this even more so the comedi is simpli not funni ash is wooden in her role while anil kapoor doe noth but shout the music is mediocr except for the titl track which is beauti picturis the onli bright point of this film sonali bendr s role is disappoint and pointless overal what could have been a great movi to rememb end up be an aw mish mash that will give some viewer sever indigest 
 
 
 
in spite of have some excit and dare sequenc nbtn just never get go there are explod boat hat pin murder mass suicid pathologist with bodi part and all sort of classic mysteri horror scene but they re interspers with extend period of pure exposit everybodi in the movi look bore this is a shame becaus mani of the sequenc would be consid dare at the time this wa film add to this the too proper brit charact and you feel like you ve drift into a sherlock holm movi final the cinematographi is veri ordinari there are lot of opportun for beauti shot of of the countrysid or complex shot of someon be pull into a huge bonfir but the whole thing is unimagin and dull definit onli for lee and cush fan 
 
 
 
i actual have a fond for christoph lee but this just wasn t up to his other perform and he wa one of the better actor the film doe not live up to it premis it s not that scari it s over melodramat and it draaaaaag everi time i thought oh here come the good part the good part never quit arriv the evil one aren t at all convinc most of the other charact were also lack in depth perhap if i d been in the proper frame of mind i might have enjoy some mstie ficat at this film s expens but naaahhh didn t realli seem to be worth the effort it wasn t realli veri good it wasn t realli veri bad it wa just mediocr 
 
 
 
in an otherwis good review loleralacartelort say the truth is that the american use a secret aluminum anti radiat alloy it is not that well known and the exact specif are a secret and whi is it a secret well whi should they reveal it back then if they where in a space race with the russian then it would be veri dumb to reveal that they had new technolog that could shield crew against radiat this is complet incorrect there is and wa no secret to radiat protect in apollo the design and construct of the apollo command modul ha long been public avail it use a lightweight honeycomb of aluminum and stainless steel the entir outer surfac except the window of cours is cover with a heat shield made of a phenol resin thicker on the bottom that face forward dure re entri these materi are actual better at stop the kind of radiat we have in space charg particl than lead which is better suit to stop ioniz photon like x ray and gamma ray space radiat is a definit problem for long term space flight becaus of the risk of big solar flare but it simpli wasn t a serious threat to the apollo astronaut the command modul gave them pretti good protect dure their brief hour or so passag through the van allen belt they all carri dosimet so we know exact how much radiat they each receiv no more than rem and usual much le of the men who flew to the moon of whom land are still aliv onli two have die from cancer alan shepard leukemia and jack swigert bone cancer the rest die from heart attack pancreat roosa and a motorcycl accid conrad these are actual pretti good statist for a group of men now in their late s shepard would be 
 
 
 
i notic that most of the peopl who think this film speak the truth were either not born befor the moon land or not old enough to appreci them i think it is much easier to question an histor event if you did not live through it i wa a youngster at the time of apollo but i wa old enough to understand what wa go on the entir world follow the moon land our famili gather around the tv to watch the launch newspap headlin scream the latest go on each day from launch to land from moonwalk to moon liftoff all the way to splashdown in a multitud of languag in school some class were cancel so we could watch the main event on tv dure apollo the world pray and held it collect breath a the men limp home to an uncertain fate you couldn t go anywher without someon ask what the latest wa the world wa truli one communiti now with a buffer of odd year after the fact it is easi to claim fraud becaus worldwid enthusiasm and interest ha die down we are left with our histori book and anybodi can claim that histori is wrong and attempt to prove it with a bunch of lie and made up fact while complet ignor the preponder of evid show otherwis not to mention the proof that dwell in the soul and memori of those who live through these wonder headi and fantast day 
 
 
 
when i wa i saw the documentari a funni thing happen on the way to the moon i actual like and believ in it for a coupl of year but then i grew up and began to think and when i had sought more inform this is more info from reel sourc and non bias sourc when i start at univers not so long ago i ask an assist professor in astronomi about these conspiraci theori what he said shock me he said that all those theori where lie that baffl me i did not believ it first but then he present evid for his claim he quick debunk most of the theori about the subject human did not go to the moon the most outrag claim wa that the apollo craft could not travel through the van allen radiat belt without the crew perish from radiat the truth is that the american use a secret aluminum anti radiat alloy it is not that well known and the exact specif are a secret and whi is it a secret well whi should they reveal it back then if they where in a space race with the russian then it would be veri dumb to reveal that they had new technolog that could shield crew against radiat and then there is the biggest evid of all the moon stone when the apollo mission did go to the moon they brought back mani rock from the moon to give to geologist and similar scientist who are document all thing about the moon these rock and stone are in fact from the moon becaus the intern basic element which all matter consist of are also made of special isotop that are differ from quarri to quarri land to land and especi planet from planet the isotop of these rock and stone have been prove that they do not come from earth the astronaut brought home hundr of kilogram s of these rock all of them have been prove to have come from outsid earth and from the same planet ergo the moon land where not fake nasa did go to anoth planet the moon though it is not a planet but a satellit to a planet a moon duuh these rock have been distribut to laboratori and univers all around the world it ha been prove human did go to the moon it is a fact pronto but i do not worri most conspiraci theorist are general unemploy and uneduc that is most whi they do not know or lie about these fact the fact remain human did walk on the moon 
 
 
 
writer director bart sibrel base his work here around a can of film that he say wa mistaken sent to him by nasa he say it show the astronaut fake the televis footag of their trip to the moon by employ camera trick the astronaut were in low earth orbit all the time and editor on the ground compos this raw footag into just a few second of finish film unfortun sibrel s research is so slipshod that he doesn t realiz his backstag footag is realli taken in larg part from the minut live telecast also on that reel that wa seen by million not hidden away in nasa vault a he impli and we have to wonder whi sibrel put his own conspiratori narrat over the astronaut audio in the footag becaus hear the astronaut in their own word clear spell out that the astronaut were just test the camera not fake footag final anyon can see the raw footag for themselv without have to buy sibrel s hack up version of it he show you more of the zaprud film of jfk s assassin than of his smoke gun sibrel think he s the onli one who s seen it what s more reveal is the clip from that raw footag that sibrel chose not to use such a those clear show the appropri distant earth be eclips by the window frame and so forth destroy his claim that matt and transpar were place in the spacecraft window to creat the illus of a faraway earth a with most film of this type sibrel reli on innuendo inexpert assumpt mislead commentari and select quotat to manipul the viewer into accept a conclus for which there is not a shred of actual evid 
 
 
 
i do regret that i have bought this seri i expect more action more object pictur and more consist this is just a pure propaganda seri veri dark without ani charm or romantic it is just boredom itself i find the actor work quit weak a well o donnel might seem charm a robin with batman but in this pictur he lack ani charm probabl while he becom older he is loo his childish charm but doe not gain ani charm of a grown up it come a no surpris that it wa not shown in a lot of countri and is be sold in the uk for of the recommend price and wa not even releas in the netherland 
 
 
 
proof that not everyth tarantino touch turn to gold this is most definit plastic all the way it easi to see that without quentin s involv this would have probabl sat on the shelf for year that s assum it would have ever got produc in the first place it is about a woman with a fascin of death who get a job clean up after crime scene angela jone is unconvinc in this role william baldwin is better a the serial killer who keep jone in employ all in all pretti poor 
 
 
 
thoughtless ignor ill conceiv career kill where is the talent angela jone now deepli unfunni garbag it s no wonder reb braddock hasn t direct anyth el sinc anyon who ha a chanc to make his first film on his own rule base on his own script with the help of quentin tarantino himself and creat someth like this anyon who feel that this wa a stori worth tell to the world doesn t deserv a second break under the circumst the perform are good the actor do what they re told to do and they do it well it s just that they shouldn t have done it in the first place out of 
 
 
 
from it s uninspir titl to the flat act perform curdl is veri much an unremark film throughout the film ha gain some fan by way of the fact that quentin tarantino s name is attach to it and the silli and out of place nod to the rodriguez tarantino flick from dusk till dawn these thing do not make a great movi howev and this is more than evid all the way through curdl the film suffer from an all too obvious lack of idea and it tri to mask this with murder that are meant to be stylish and event that are suppos to be disturb the mexican music score that accompani mani of the sequenc in the film is obvious meant to be cool but it s becom annoy veri quick especi a asid from the fact that the lead charact is mexican it doesn t fit with the tone of the movi the film s plot is typic offbeat and it follow a gorehound who becaus of her ob with grisli murder take a job with a firm that clean up murder scene it sound bore and it is william baldwin is the onli name on the cast list and even he doesn t make an impress he hasn t been given anyth to do in the movi and asid from talk to his victim and stand around tri to look menac he s pretti much wast angela jone or rather the taxi driver from pulp fiction take the lead role a the murder ob young woman and it is alway clear that it s her involv with pulp fiction that won her this role not her act abil she may have been good enough in her small role in tarantino s masterpiec but she doesn t have the talent to lead a film by herself she look lost and out of place for the major of the film and if it weren t for her latino accent she wouldn t convinc the audienc that she s a weirdo on ani level curdl is a one hundr percent proof piec of forgett trash film like this often win themselv prais for invent or black comed antic but this one fail on all level whether you re a tarantino fan william baldwin fan horror fan or just a movi buff this is one to miss 
 
 
 
excruci slow pace over script black comedi with a too clever premis and bad act mayb this would have work a a twilight zone or tale from the crypt episod but by the last half you just want it to get to it predict end and be done with it alreadi 
 
 
 
usual i m a bit of a fan of the bad eighti earli nineti film featur now ha been but this film is so incred terribl that it wa a real endur test to sit through guy dress up a girl ha been done to death but never so pathet corey haim s perform wa abysm a usual nicol eggert wa not much better this ha no redeem qualiti even if you are a number fan of an actor actress in this piec of trash stay away 
 
 
 
i d never seen a tarzan movi befor so when i saw it on the tele i thought i d give it a shot unfortun i have to say i wa disappoint tarzan wa over year old and somewhat overweight not how i d imagin tarzan would look and unless i miss it while make myself a cup of tea tarzan never gave his tradit warbl yell also miss wa tarzan swing through the tree leap from vine to vine oh well so much for expect anyway jane wa there the monkey cheeta wa there there wa some guy with a guitar there there were villain and good guy and a romanc all veri harmless and predict noth bad you understand but equal noth good probabl not the best movi to introduc tarzan 
 
 
 
be warn this movi tell lot of love stori without ani coher the onli intent of this movi seem to be show love in mani differ way each stori ha onli a few minut so there is no develop of charact and near no plot just an sketchi idea of a plot the writer tri to build in turn point that aim to surpris the viewer howev that just didn t work out becaus you didn t get to know the charact in befor or these joke were just silli this is a movi about love that fail to reach your heart a dozen time or even more i don t know and i don t care

base upon the recommend of a friend my wife and i invit anoth coupl to this film i realli apolog to them all of u hate it and spent the whole time look at our watch wait for the film to final end half the vignett are bizarr with veri littl entertain valu there were few scene of pari for exampl i wa look forward to see some pictur of the latin quarter but i couldn t realli recogn anyth most of the scene wa insid a bar no one in the theater laugh at anyth or react in ani way if you like bizarr pretenti pseudo intellectu film don t miss this if you are down to earth like me you will be sorri you saw it 
 
 
 
about three minut into this thing i start fast forward paus onli dure the nuditi whi is it that bad movi alway includ such good look woman in ten minut i wa done and wish i could get my money back from the rental store the peopl who write these movi should be sanction by the mpaa come on writer the bad guy alway get into the car with the bomb activ by the good guy s remot control that s the way it been done sinc the day of the ottoman empir also to add insult to injuri the twist at the end wa so formula that it could have come from ani action movi written in the past year burt reynold wa fine but he should concentr on real movi this movi is just a wast of time run away run away 
 
 
 
don t get fool with all the big name like burt reynold jame wood and ann archer they are just glorifi extra s their scene were probabl film in one day or so whatev their motiv for be in this movi if you have an actor like jame wood you better make good use of him to me this is a sign of bad direct through and through the plot itself wasn t that bad and the act from most of the actor wa abov averag cuba good jr howev wa terribl he wa so unbeliev that i almost laugh at his dramat scene and sinc this wa meant a a serious movi that can t be a good thing the action scene were not bad but they lack that special punch to make it more excit again better direct wa need also the pace wa wrong for a movi like this it took the main charact almost half an hour to get in action for an action thriller of onli minut that is far too slow the onli redeem factor is angi harmon she doe her best to make it all work too bad the director left her hang yes this movi could have been much better with a great director andi cheng is far too inexperienc a a director to pull it off and for an action stunt coordin of his calib you d expect at least more excit action scene don t wast your time with this one avoid 
 
 
 
an ensembl of uninterest and unlik charact twist and turn their way through a flimsi plot that might be interest if onli you could bring yourself to care this twist and turn i speak of refer not to the stori which contain all the suspens of a recip for tuna casserol but to the director s inabl to keep the charact face even remot center in the frame on the other hand angi harmon ha veri nice nostril and left ear the onli real surpris in the movi is the big name they convinc to do it when you consid this movi wa never releas in theater despit have an all star cast you might be inclin to think someth stink and inde it doe 
 
 
 
mst should do this movi it is the worst act movi i have ever seen first of all you find out that the shooter ha no bank account and no histori sinc leav the armi in and pay his rent in cash there is no way in hell that a person like that would ever be allow to be that close to a presid not to mention a high profil job also the head of secur for the pothus would not be so emot that he would start drink into a haze if the presid wa shot this movi suck i cannot express the extremit that this movi wa everi singl actor wa terribl even the chick at the trailer park i crap on this garbag what a wast of time 
 
 
 
this rank a one of the worst movi i ve seen in year besid cuba and angi the act is actual embarrass wasn t archer onc a decent actress what happen to her the action is decent but complet implaus the make up is so bad it s worth mention i mean who ever even think about the makeup in a contemporari featur film someon should tell the make up artist and the dop that you re not suppos to actual see it the end is a massiv disappoint along the line of and then they realiz it wa all a dream don t wast your time or your money you re better off just stare into space for hour 
 
 
 
i rent end game have never heard of it but i m fond of polit thriller so i thought i d give it a shot after do some research on the movi i found that it had initi been intend for theatric releas but instead had gone strait to dvd after see it i m think no wonder the movi is shock in it unorigin the plot and the charact are perfunctori i figur out whodunnit by the half way mark but the end wa a curv ball i have to say i didn t expect it to end quit the way it did but that s not a point in it favor the more predict end would have been prefer to one that is so bad perhap the film maker saw how predict the film wa and so they decid to throw in a twist even one that made the movi even wors stay away i want the and my minut back 
 
 
 
this movi look good good cast evergreen topic and an explos open it went downhil from there whi wa it film by hand held camera it shake judder part captur scene and simpli confus the viewer a poor choic inde a if this wa not enough the worst edit in memori assum a drug viewer mandatori if you want to get ani enjoy from it at all and then it commit the worst sin of all after lead the viewer down all sort of unlik and implaus scenario to the point of exhaust they roll credit without reveal the denouement the end the payoff like what the heck wa the motiv how can you expect to succeed by make thriller without an end doh this movi had great promis and end up do a face plant in the mud what a wast of effort poor effort by writer and director 
 
 
 
onli a hand of the segment are engag here a segment with a garag attend from nigeria is heartbreak one with fanni ardent bob hoskin make it point twist by twist until the final shot overplay thing the problem with this movi is that onli a few of the clip invok pari the other are so scatter shot in theme tone volit product that you may a well be watch the year best commerci it s realli all over the place it doesn t develop over it s run time and noth reign the director in no construct success join the piec tedium set in i m at the one hour twenti minut point and elijah wood is in some dumb over commerci overproduc vampir shtick it ha about a much to do with pari a old ladi knit in the antart fantasi show up i think first in the coen brother segment uh thank j e for ruin anoth movi and then make way too mani appear the point of be in pari is that you don t need make believ crap to make your day extraordinari whi divid it by neighborhood if quartier de la madelein is equat with vampir for some loser director ha there ever been a genr more over repres than the vampir film everi three year we get the same lame vampir clich s make thing wors is that the switch from segment to segment is pretti artless the transit get lost this doesn t feel intent it feel sloppi 
 
 
 
spoiler ahead this is one of the worst movi ever made it s that simpl there is not one redeem qualiti about this movi the first minut are quit tricki they actual lead you to believ that this film will be shock and will have you on the edg of your seat instead you will spend minut punch yourself while watch stolen and poor made scene run without ani organ the lake wa ridicul look like an aquarium and had the same plant in differ part of the lake bed charact show their advanc teleport power for exampl alex thoma who fall into the lake drunk and then end up on his boat in an imposs posit angi harmon put up a piti perform a kate made wors by the space time continuum ruptur dialog that appear to have been written at the last minut by a fifth grader an exampl of this would be when she said flashlight in such a stupid manner that it show the threshold of how much a human bodi can cring befor it snap in half final the edit of this movi wa by far the most bizarr and horrif that i have ever seen it wa like the cameraman were a bunch of chimp who had been given camcord by scientist an exampl of this would be when we sudden get a closeup of the headlight on alex s car i would bet that there wa littl to no time spent edit this movi the end wa absolut pathet the writer were obvious tri to creat some sort of mysteri plot line that made the viewer say oh yeah instead we re left to view some dumb paint of a spider that somehow fit into the stori line unfortun there is not one perspect in the million out there that could save this movi from be a fester piec of crap i give this a out of the be from the fact that this movi wa record on film instead of becom a pictur book 
 
 
 
so i m look to rent a dvd and i come across this movi call end game it star jame wood and cuba good jr and ha the synopsi of a taught polit thriller well worth a look then or so i thought boy wa i wrong end game ha just about the most ridicul plot i have ever had the displeasur of endur now be someth of a whodunnit i can t realli tear into it a i would like without ruin it for those who have yet to experi this monstros but question such a whi ha he she they done this and where on earth did they get the resourc to pull this off are all too abund follow the film s unintent hilari conclus a for the act you know those film where you can almost feel that an actor s realis that they ve made a terribl mistak in sign on for a movi and this then show in their perform this is one of those accompani this with a laughabl script and serious flaw irrit direct and you have the recip for cinemat poison of cours this didn t make it to the cinema and for the same reason you should not allow it into your live room it is appal 
 
 
 
predict hackney poor written foolish i reason such a promin cast would not be involv unless it had merit i guess competit amongst actor is so intens these day and will onli get wors that one cannot pick and choos much ani more earli on we were given an inkl who wa wa instrument in the assassin and we had it ram down our throat ever sinc the movi lack intrigu give u littl insight into the victim and onli one possibl motiv for the murder some of the discours wa frank embarrass it s hard to believ anyon would even consid let alon commit to the spend of ten of million of dollar to make this tripe 
 
 
 
plea help the economi spend your money elsewher the synopsi of the movi is the first ladi ha her husband assassin becaus he wa cheat on her that s it undetect by anyon except cuba and angi she design and implement a vast assassin conspiraci which no one know about and get away complet free some specif point are particular hilari while stand in front of the presid cuba a deflect the assassin s bullet which then enter the back of the presid s head cuba and angi watch film from a news camera and they see a clue they go to great length to protect the film believ that they are the onli peopl that have a copi of this veri public film cuba speak with a presidenti staff member the psm comment that there wa no conspiraci cuba claim there wa more than one person involv the psm then rant that the conspiraci includ the fbi the cia and the nsa gosh i wonder is the psm is involv m archer the first ladi is a craptacular artist cuba can t make out a paint and she say you re too close stand back look from a differ perspect look from my perspect can anyon miss that clue

my wife and i just finish this movi and i came onto to imdb to commiser with the review that found this movi le than satisfactori howev of the page of review onli a hand are negat i feel that this movi is a great concept gone horribl awri and i want to warn those who are look to watch the movi into the futur i admit i m more inspir to write review when i don t like a movi than a to when i do so my hand of review are all negat still that doesn t mean i m bias toward not enjoy a movi but i often find more eloqu review of movi i do enjoy pari je t aim is the most pretenti movi i ve seen in year by use an intellig concept and attach some big talent to a coupl of the way to mani short stori the movi end up the worst of all world it is art for art sake but someth that a year old could dream up and accomplish give the director free reign of minut of screen time prove whi there is a divis of labor even in entertain director can t write writer can t direct i d like to throw in also that clint eastwood is overr but that is becaus he s an actor turn director which rare work either what end up on the screen is a garbl mess of short stori that don t make ani sen are not complet in minut and in total spoil pari to me whi call it pari je t aim when a more apropo titl is cluster f ck there are onli a coupl stori that are watchabl most notabl the piec by alfonso cuar n but everyth el will fall into obscur the coen brother short is passabl but can you name a movi of their that doe not contain a scene with a pick guitar it s a if all the director decid on do whatev it is they want to do and chose pari a the place to do it a we all love pari present compani includ we are blind by the fact that this movi suck in fact i think they put the director name on each of the short becaus director saw how poor of a film this is and decid to make sure they were blame onli for their minut serious serious peopl natali portman is not a good actress she is is not a pixi dream girl wait to be your and maggi gyllenha whi are you peopl act or just regurgit perform from other movi i m look at you natali portman garden state closer elijah wood sin citi and catalina sandino moreno maria full of grace one final comment on the act i give doubl kudo to nick nolt for act and look more human than you have in age or perhap ever will again find his short on youtub a his minut are quit enjoy write short stori is veri difficult and onli a hand of author have gotten it right i m think of ernst hemingway raymond carver f scott fitzgerald and john cheever just to name a few it is much harder than write a full novel and onli the truli talent can accomplish this the same can be said about short film it appear that onli one director will live on in the annal of histori if you uphold pari a a gem to be discov and reflect through your own lens with your own stori then don t expect to enjoy this movi at all the director either didn t care or were lazi in either scenario by the time you are read this it mean you rent it prais be that you didn t pay dollar a head in theater for it 
 
 
 
 ok i have read about this film somewher in the internet and mani critic on how bad and suck this film wa and i couldn t have been more agre about it then after that i saw this film on dvd i wa think twice about this and then came commerci of this film on tv luckili i spare my money for this piec of crap i wa sacrif my sleep for this film and soon it turn out that this film couldn t make me satisfi so i can t be judg on how the film wa made but anyway it still suck a for those who like this film i would apolog for flame this film and tell on how suck this film is i don t know what do you think about this film 
 
 
 
on the surfac this movi would appear to deal with the psycholog process call individu that is how to becom a true self by embrac the so call dark side of human natur thus we have the darkl a classic shadowi devilish creatur desper seek the compani that is recognit of men and the stori revolv around the various way in which this need is handl more or le success howev if we dig a littl deeper we find that what this movi is actual about is how you should relat to your car like you would to ani other person in the open scene the main charact male car mechan fallen from grace is collect bit and piec from car wreck with his daughter when a car wreck near smash the littl girl lesson car are person embodi with immort soul and steal from car wreck is ident with grave robberi the wick have disturb the dead and must be punish just after that anoth charact rubin buy a car wreck intend to repair it and sell it a a onc lost now found famous race car and is warn by the salesman lesson just like ani other person a car ha a uniqu ident that cannot be alter nor replac in addit there is the twist that rubin actual see a hidden qualiti in what most peopl would just think of a junk but eventu that qualiti turn out to be a project of rubin s own person greed for more profit lesson thou shalt never treat thi car a a mean onli but alway a an end in itself then we have the scene where the main charact is introduc to rubin and more import rubin s car the main charact s ass of the car s qualiti is not just base on it outer appear but also by a thorough look insid the engin room lesson a car is not just to be judg by it look it is what is insid that realli count there is punish in store for those who do not keep this lesson in mind a we see in the scene where anoth man tri to sell rubin a fake collector s car this scene by the way also underlin the import of lesson there are numer other exampl in the movi of the car person theme and i am too tire now to bother cite all of them but the point remain and i guess this is what i m realli tri to say that this movi is fun to watch if you have absolut noth el to do or if you re a car devote 
 
 
 
first of all i thought it wa naughti of them to say in the credit that the stori and screenplay were by preston sturg sturg wa one of the better hollywood screenwrit until his talent fade and he retir howev it wasn t the preston sturg it wa preston sturg jr the stori wa essenti base on robert loui stevenson s short stori the bottl imp a good man come into posse of an evil object that will grant him ani wish but which will ultim doom him to hell that s fine nobodi said screenwrit had to be origin the actor are general pretti compet given the mediocr write that they had to translat onto the screen my biggest complaint come with the end the hero think he ha discov a way out of his dilemma but tri to solv the problem in a somewhat differ way in an attempt to save an innoc person at first this seem to have work but true to the code of the modern horror film they feel they have to provid one last dollop of horror at the veri end of the film this is a stupid convent the older horror film got along just fine with allow the hero to win out at the end there is noth wrong with good triumph over evil no matter what the current crop of film maker seem to think you can give the audienc a good healthi scare and still make them feel happi at the end in fact i think it s prefer 
 
 
 
yes i sat through the whole thing god know whi it wa a long afternoon i had noth to do it wa bitter cold outsid okay those are all lame excus but they re the onli one i have i gave the darkl star out of a possibl i have seen wors film but this one definit is right there in the old trash bin of bad filmdom poor script poor act bad light and cheesi special effect the storylin which never complet make sen revolv around this simpl littl famili daddi mommi and littl girl that i assum the viewer is suppos to be identifi with all three of them were tedious and annoy you just want the dark side to get everi one of them daddi is a cook whose hobbi is car daddi meet a rich man name rubin who collect car and who is also in posse of a be he purchas in the mysteri orient rubin keep it in a birdcag and refer to it a the darkl dure the cours of the film the darkl is explain a be about or differ thing a shadow without a person the inner dark that exist in all of u and the devil so take your pick of whichev one of those explan suit your fanci becaus trust me it doesn t realli matter the darkl s main problem seem to be that it crave have a companion it get a human companion and then eventu is dissatisfi with the human be this of cours lead to immens wealth follow by disast for the human who hook up with the darkl and for the rest of u it just lead to a veri long tedious movi

what happen what we have here is basic a solid and plausibl premis and with a decent and talent cast but somewher the movi lose it actual it never realli got go there wa a littl excit when we find out that angi is not realli pregnant then find out that she is after all but that wa it steve martin who is a veri talent person and usual bring a lot to a movi wa dread and his entir charact wa not even close to be import to this movi other than to make it longer i realli would have like to see more interact between the main charact kate and angi and mayb tri not for a pure comedi which unfortun it wa not but mayb a drama with comed element i think if the movi did this it could have been veri funni sinc both actress are quit funni in their own way and sit here i can think of numer scenario that would have been a riot

i wouldn t say this total suck but if it wasn t for netflix i wouldn t even have this in my hous steve martin s eccentr presid of a chain of health food store fall flat he s just not funni he s anoth in a long slew of snl reject that can onli find work whore themselv to the next snl movi the birth coach with the elmer fudd lisp is about a funni a it is origin ami poehler simpli goe through the same motion she would for a minut snl skit which is about a funni a snl late the onli thing go for this movi is that tina fey is easi on the eye the end wa predict a soon a you heard her charact couldn t get pregnant the subject matter could have open up to other comed attempt but it seem to simpl simmer along not realli entertain or creat laugh 
 
 
 
i agre with the previous comment the begin of the movi is quit good and get s you wander about what is to come which is noth all open stori line remain open two charact who at first seem like they might be of some import are complet left out of the pictur save for or veri short scene i wander if ilya wouldn t have done better to just complet leav them out a for the one remain charact noth is done with her either she just visit some god aw place and sudden the movi isn t about her anymor but about some geriatr witch who spend their day make doll out of bread drink homemad vodka and appar flash each other some may say the movi doe well in show a societi crumbl like the judg of the iffr but for me it is just bad tast bad camera work a lousi script and fright bad direct therefor i can not be a generous a my predecessor when it come to grade 
 
 
 
the first hour of the movi wa bore a hell there is no suspens no action not even a plot the movi went no where i mean they could have made the movi in min short film overal the movi wasn t good at all and i don t recommend it 
 
 
 
film start with peopl meet each other in the bar ok they re talk about their imaginari live lie all the time with no reason still ok from time to time they even make you laugh interest first minut you actual enjoy it but then thing becom wors noth s happen for a long time and then when someth happen all you can see are nake old ladi touch each other not ok disgust by the way this part should be the top of the movi but it s everyth except that movi ha no point it s bore and sick the strangest thing is that here belgrad serbia on fest film festiv this movi wa the most popular accord to research of cours befor peopl watch it i even thought befor watch hay this might be interest although it s a russian movi but god no 
 
 
 
the russian movi follow the live of three not four stranger who meet one night in a local bar one is a musician one a frozen meat seller and one a call girl i gather is intend to showcas the dreari and hopeless of life in post soviet russia the charact have to make up stori to make their live appear more interest than they realli are but the movi is so incoher and bore that i serious doubt veri mani peopl will be abl to sit all the way through it there seem to be a suggest run through the film that the shadowi russian govern is up to some shadi do behind the scene oper secret clone facil sell decad old frozen meat etc but the movi is so formless and incomprehens that i doubt anyon could figur out what anybodi s realli up to here despit decent act and a few incis direct scene is a two hour long endur contest that should be avoid at all cost 
 
 
 
i m start to think that there s a conspiraci all right one that involv a wallop of money paid to those who have access to publish column in newspap and film and art magazin to ensur that this or that film despit it obscur will reach a higher status via a rate point which will tag it with a univers acclaim or someth within that rang thus ensur unsuspect folk like me will wander into theatr or rent the bloodi thing expect a surpris onli to find myself race to the bathroom to upchuck this movi is one of them it ha definit make me bypass ani and everi post articl i come across becaus it s rather clear that two thing might have happen either i didn t get the messag that is so hidden beneath this film s inner realm a to be imposs to access or they and i watch two entir differ movi that happen to share the same name is a dirti trick on the audienc it s no wonder that it appear and disappear faster than you can say smorsgabord and that despit the rate it got on metacrit no one had heard of it it s terribl with sugar on top first there is the ever present number four from start to finish while have a littl symbol here and there is okay and it s been done with various degre of success in mani well known movi this movi is pant with it four dog at the start of the movi look at the camera in a heretofor empti street when sudden machineri drop onto the foreground and proceed to rip open the asphalt four peopl in a bar although one of them is a non entiti three of them go their separ way but are link nevertheless not onli to each other but to what their live are not while this concept may work the movi meander so much particular with the stori of the would be model play by marina vovchenko which goe into the territori of the extrem bizarr and not in a good way that the initi theme get lost in translat or mayb like i said befor i just didn t get it the problem also lie in that so much time is spent on marina s stori which revolv on the death of her sister from bread chew no le and the subsequ shrill mourn which follow that ani interest in the inher surreal dissip without a trace so what if the same horrifi tale that the three stranger interchang in a bar seem to have a truth of their own the director doesn t invest much time in truli tie them togeth or weav a tighter stori that could in a david lynchian way intersect either with the past present or within altern dimens or even a a straightforward mundan scienc fiction stori this is an uphil battl against an insurmount wall that onli a saint or someon into the weird for weird s sake could endur 
 
 
 
i have yet to read a negat profession review of this movi i guess i must have miss someth the begin is intrigu the three main charact meet late at night in an otherwis empti bar and entertain each other with invent stori that s the best part after the three go their separ way the film split into three thread that s when boredom set in certain the thread with the felliniesqu babushka who make doll out of chew bread is at first an eye open curio unfortun the director beat this one to death even inject a wild plot line that lead nowher in particular bottom line a two hour plot thin listless if you suffer from insomnia view it in bed and you will have a good night sleep 
 
 
 
the movi start quit with an intrigu scene three peopl are drink and make small talk in a bar all of them are make up a bit outrag stori a the movi unfold it turn out that the most outrag stori is true howev beyond that the movi is not veri interest except for the scene in the bar and the scene where main secret is reveal this revel happen bare half time into the movi and frank not much is left to be seen the rest of the time director is linger in a god forsaken russian villag full of piti and creepi old ladi sure these are fascin and a bit shock imag but admir them goe on way too long sacrif ani possibl plot or charact develop i found this movi a anoth exampl of either lousi or lazi movi make where instead of tri to make an interest stori movi maker concentr on weird fascin imageri and through in a few almost unrel stori case in point meat trader s stori to leav the spectat to figur out all odd and end on a surfac it ha artsi appear but in this particular case is noth more than lack of talent 
 
 
 
i can t believ that so much talent can be wast in one movi the gingerbread man start of on the right foot and manag to build up some great expect for the end but at some point the movi turn into one of the worst stori i ve ever wast my time on it s just so unbeliev how the bewitch mallori dos manag to pull kenneth branagh s charact around by his nose the movi climax is a uninterest and flat a a beer which ha been left out in the sun too long the gingerbread man is probabl the worst grisham movi ever and this isn t chang by the fact that talent star crowd the movi don t wast your time here 
 
 
 
mabel at the wheel is one of those movi with a behind the scene stori that s more interest than the movi itself this wa chaplin s tenth comedi for keyston dure his year of apprenticeship and his first two reeler here he play one of his last out and out villain role although the featur length tilli s punctur romanc wa yet to come and it also mark one of the last time he would work for a director other than himself in fact chaplin s conflict with director and co star mabel normand almost got him fire from the studio chaplin hadn t gotten along with his earlier director henri lehrman and georg nichol but accord to his autobiographi have to take direct from a mere girl wa the last straw charli and mabel argu bitter dure the make of this film chaplin wa still a newcom at keyston and his colleagu didn t know what to make of him but everyon love mabel produc mack sennett wa on the verg of fire chaplin when he learn that the newcom s film were catch on and exhibitor want more of them a s a p so chaplin wa promis the chanc to direct himself in return for finish this movi the way mabel want it unfortun none of that drama is visibl on screen in mabel at the wheel which look like typic keyston chao the stori concern an auto race in which mabel s beau harri mccoy is schedul to compet but wick charli and his henchman abduct the lad and mabel must take the wheel in his place for all the race around brick hurl and finger bite the film is frank short on laugh but there are a few point of interest there s some good cinematographi and edit in the race sequenc though there aren t realli ani gag just lot of frantic activ chaplin himself look odd sport a goat like beard on his chin and wear the top hat and frock coat he wore in his veri first film appear make a live but the outfit suit the old fashion villaini he display throughout at least it s novel to watch him play such an uncharacterist role visibl in the stand at the race track are such keyston stalwart a chester conklin edgar kennedi in a strang dandifi get up and a more characterist mack sennett spit tobacco and do his usual mindless rube routin a a perform sennett wa about a subtl a the movi he produc but you have to give the guy credit he knew what peopl like these film were huge popular in their day mack s perform doesn t add much to mabel at the wheel but he probabl had to be on hand for the film of this one to make sure his star didn t kill each other 
 
 
 
i tri to sit through this bomb not too long ago what a disast the act wa atroci there were some absolut pathet action scene that fell flat a a lead balloon this wa main due to the fact that the reaction of the actor just didn t ring true suppos a modern rework of the hitchcock origin lifeboat i think hictcock would be spin circl in his grave at the veri thought of it from what i wa abl to suffer through there is noth compel in this movi it boast a few semi big name but they put no effort into their charact but you know to be fair it wa nobodi s fault realli i mean i m pretti sure the script blew up in the first explos lol it is possibl that this thing end up improv a it goe along but for me i m not will to spend at least three day to find out so unless you have at least a three day weekend on the horizon avoid this stinker 
 
 
 
bore predict by the number horror outing at least ha pretti good special effect and plenti of mindless mayhem and gore to satisfi mindless genr fan most it s about giant rat chomp on a set of charact we don t care an iota about if that s your thing tune in 
 
 
 
who could possibl have wish for a sequel to bert i gordon s legendari bad trash film food of the god nobodi of cours but director damien lee thought it wa a good idea anyway and he put togeth a belat sequel that stand a one of the most redund movi in horror histori gnaw is a sequel in name onli a the set move to a typic late s locat a univers campus and also the cheap cheesi gore effect perfect illustr the s this script hang togeth by clich s aw written dialog and plot situat that are not so subt stolen from other and more success horror classic neil hamilton is a goodi two shoe scientist who perform grow experi on ordinari rodent in order to do a fellow scientist a favor due to some incred stupid anim right activist the huge and raven rat escap and devour pretti much everyon on campus follow the good old tradit that spielberg s jaw start there s an obnoxi dean who refus to admit the problem even though sever mutil corp are turn up everywher dure a hyster grotesqu climax the rat invad the open ceremoni of the campus new sport complex gnaw food of the god is terribl bad and therefor a lot of fun to watch the charact do and say unimagin stupid stuff like descend into the sewer unarm while they know it s infest with rat the act is atroci and there s a genuin bizarr sequenc involv the hero have sex under the influenc of growth serum i wonder what freud s theori would be on that there s a satisfi amount of gore and sleaz and it ha to be said the music is surpris atmospher in case you just can t get enough of this junk there are quit a lot of creatur featur revolv on mutat rat like the italian schlock film rat night of terror the modest s cult film willard and it lame sequel ben the willard remak star crispin glover and the surpris good recent rat movi by onc famous director tibor ticak rat and john lafia the rat go nut 
 
 
 
noth to say but wow ha anyon actual had somebodi sneak up on them in an open field well this happen about time in this movi clear the director favorit scare tactic in one of the open scene the smooth talk hot shot produc ha to ride in the back seat so the camera man could sit in the front to film short after he arriv to the field the contest show up and although it is clear at latest in the afternoon they are all convinc that the sun will set ani minut after about minut of boobless trash we are privileg with a flashback of the clown s histori in which we see some of his previous victim if you watch this movi check out the ladi chest her rib go all the way to her neck it wa flat out disgust most horror movi action occur dure the night but without a night vision camera the chao is forc to happen dure the day the few night shot that did make it in to the movi look like they were stolen from the blair witch project or random shot from the director backyard the movi somewhat redeem itself in the end when there wa a matrix like shoot out with the clown that we rewound and watch over and over laugh hyster definit rent this movi if you have ever been snuck up on in an open field sign the answer
 
 
 
whi did i wast my money on this on the last day of sundanc i want a refund can i have my back while i wa watch this film i kept wait for someth to happen noth did happen the onli way i even knew what it wa suppos to be about wa by read the plot which wa not realli like the film whi did the director zoom in with their handi cam and then zoom out it wa not veri artist whi did the director show lulu file her nail for fifteen minut whi is it when the actor tri to speak they sound like they were read or wa that the point i felt like phantom love had no stori at all and to be honest i felt like my friend vacat video had a much higher entertain valu than this film 
 
 
 
del you are the dumbest smart person i ve ever met calvin well i had a brain but they lost it in the re write i think what i find most egregi about this bastard of asimov s work wa how the charact of susan calvin wa portray in the book she wa actual one of the first strong femal protagonist abl to think her way through a problem here she s just a damsel in distress wait to be rescu by wil smith there are pas refer to asimov s law of robot but they are an afterthought to the cgi and action scene smith is likabl a he is in most of his film but honest the stori isn t that good you figur it out long befor these genius charact do 
 
 
 
wait to go insid the theathr with ticket in my hand i expect an interest sci fi fantasi movi which could final feed my appetit of movi regard robot technolog instead i went disappoint by each aspect of it onc more prove that stun special effect can t help a bore plot which by my opinion wa the wors in this year act in this movi also dissatisfi me will smith didn t show anyth new in this movi yet i never saw his act to chang sinc men in black which wa his onli success by my opinion he had to retir sinc than not spoil his name with titl like i robot and men in black 
 
 
 
in spite of the great futur design touch the clever asimov premis and will smith s depend cool perform this movi doesn t live up to expect the clich s come thick and fast wake from a recur nightmar maverick cop ha his badg revok by hardass lieuten to list more would be spoil it you can see the end a mile off this movi is also stagebound you never feel that you have travel anywher what s suppos to be a global disast never leav an obvious cgi chicago the robot themselv are good in closeup but the crowd scene look more like bad disney the cgi is overdon again and again and if you can destroy the robot by smash them whi do they need to inject nanit you know it s a duff movi when stupid question like that start to bother you befor the climax it could have been great but it s le than the sum of it part main due to the utter predict plot that could have come from ani action film of the last forti year 
 
 
 
this film is the culmin of everyth that is bad about modern film unnecessari slow motion unnecessari flip jump somersault unnecessari charact unnecessari dialogu basic unnecess is that a word well it s just been invent by i robot what happen to practic i e the car garag the skin spray the onli tool that show a combin of futurist and realist function is the card swipe at the coffe shop what happen to show respect for woman i e smith s charact doe noth but degrad the doctor for the better part of the film and yet she still want him where is the tension i ll tell you where good look and not admir or common ground what happen to a detect that detect smith did noth but sit around and feel sorri for himself complain to other peopl and when they said someth that spark a thought he wa off this is such a lame way to get the stori from point b c d etc it wa ok onc but not sever time in a row speak of sever time in a row what wa the i m snore and not listen to you joke twice in one scene what happen to the small part in a movi be somewhat meaning and not just a tool to promot rescu scene shia labeouf the kid is in the movi for a total of two scene we know that a he degrad woman and b he know smith so of cours we should care about him and whether or not he come to harm what happen to hero s let s just forget that there are peopl woman and child everywher get attack by robot and selfish save the onli person with my view that i have an acquaint with and whi did he have to ramp his bike through the air show off while the doctor wa somehow abl to reach the same distanc in a matter of second on foot don t get me wrong i m all for spectacl but i m also all for a shred of realism and mean i have to say i ve never laugh quit so hard at a film in a long time so thank alex i pray for the swing of the social pendulum back to simpler techniqu simpler stori and simpler everyth el in film but main simpler techniqu big budget action film you so have to die 
 
 
 
this wa an impuls pick up for me from the local video store don t make the same mistak i did this movi is tedious unconvinc act and general bore the dialogu between the young priest and his uncl is particular poor written and deliv i cring at everi scene they share denni hopper make a few spar appear and is his usual disjoint self his role wa clear not a stretch for him and although the movi is suppos set in puerto rico it feel a lot more like a hollywood movi lot all of the main charact are caucasian and sever tend to speak english with pseudo irish accent odd anyway when you see this one on the shelf of your local video store keep walk 
 
 
 
first of all what is good in the movi some pretti actress the exot background the fact that the actor don t laugh while act i would have if i had been in their situat i don t know the storylin is simpl a cathol priest who doe abstract paint tri to find out who anoth abstract painter kill his littl brother a male prostitut rape by anoth priest when he wa young i m afraid there is noth here to learn or to let think a littl about serial killer art or religion denni hopper is not veri good here this is the worst episod of the worst season of profil the seri with replac actor and unbeliev coincid the uncl is the policeman who the girl who live at anoth victim s hous could have a babi with the priest etc etc 
 
 
 
not onli wa this the most expens canadian film ever shot in bc but easili the worst never see the light of day the director is not even canadian but british and boy doe it show we are all made out to be a bunch of over sex dope fiend and moron the spirit of what it mean to be canadian is absent and this is suppos to be the reason we fund this bunk of cours the british charact is normal the rest are a crop of sitcom stereotyp can you say norm the cinematographi rang from pretti postcard imag to murki indoor silhouett the actor alway seem to be fidget are they a bore a the viewer or is this the director idea of cinema avoid this mess and check out some of bruce mcdonald film a true canadian boy with someth origin to say cinemat you won t be compel to walk out on his film after minut 
 
 
 
this movi make canadian and brit out to be asinin moron idiot the men get stone drunk and then they yell beat each other up in almost everi scene the woman are superflu to the stori i do not understand what they are there for they spend everi scene caus a ruckus or wors mill around like mesmer cattl appar canadian woman are either quarrelsom vulgar tramp or hulk hippi chick it s the standard knock up girlfriend her loser boyfriend and his wick mother ludicr that we have seen in countless movi befor everi charact here is a carp infantil stereotyp not to mention that they all look like they need a shower and the idea of ani kind of scene impli sex with georg wendt shudder is enough to make anyon gag i watch the movi becaus samuel west wa in it but i cannot understand whi he would have accept a role like this mayb he need the money ian tracey is a superb actor the onli one with a vagu redeem moment but his talent is wast here a for the rest of the plot the three imbecil tri to get their dope back yawn or karl who is dead but who is actual a charact veri much aliv in the mind of those left behind almost like rebecca in alfr hitchcock s masterpiec although i am asham to even have thought to compar these two film whi even bother karl is so gall that you find the circumst of his death gratifi by the end of this wretch movi i thought they would all have been better off go down with him on that boat 
 
 
 
i found this on the shelf while housesit and bore how can peopl possibl give this a it s not just that it s suppos to be a feel good redempt film i think becaus it doesn t work on that level either weak plot bad dialogu terribl act there s just noth there harvey keitel is decent but ha noth to work with and bridget fonda and especi johnathon schaech are just terribl the plot progress especi the relationship between byron and ashley make no sen it seem like the writer want the plot to go a certain way and made it without actual write in the necessari bit to make it flow it s onli an hour and a half but that s minut of your life you ll never get back 
 
 
 
might contain possibl spoiler not that anyth in this film is new or will even mild surpris you for that matter whi doe disney feel the need to recycl everyth they ever made into oblivion sure it s cheaper for them but after a while wouldn t you think there overal qualiti and the way peopl think of them would drop off hous of villain is a despic display of cartoon crossov that make absolut no sen at all some sign of the total disregard for previous film in this are the voic don t even remot match up and iago is evil again sinc when i know that these film are direct toward child but there wa a time when all could enjoy disney film even the movi s music number which had been disney s specialti for year stunk i wouldn t recommend this film to anyon even the veri young all i can is that if more of these movi of the same calib are releas it s onli a matter of time befor some small anim studio surpass disney in overal qualiti

when my wife and i decid to watch this movi we thought it couldn t fail i love billi crystal my wife love julia robert and everyon we talk to said they love it we were misl in spade on my part i felt billi crystal s charact wa extrem one dimension and did veri littl for the film sure he crack a coupl of good joke but a a charact he did noth but take up space and poor julia robert in past show she play well a a strong will self determin ladi in this flick she seem complet repress and had veri littl fire this is not the julia robert that my wife enjoy watch ok if i were to find one good thing it would have to be christoph walken now that s entertain but just like billi crystal hard anyth is shown of his charact if you re look for a night of mindless laugh with veri littl redeem valu go see it but if you re look for a smart romant comedi this is not your film it s none of the abov 
 
 
 
charact you don t care about relationship you don t care about and you sit through all that to see the end you knew wa come from the start julia robert usual leav no impress on me one way or the other she wa actual somewhat endear in this role 
 
 
 
have you ever heard the say that peopl telegraph their intent well in this movi the charact action do more than telegraph futur plan they show up at your hous drunk and buffet you about the head this could be forgiven if the set had been use better or if the charact were more charismat or nuanc embeth davidtz s charact is not mysteri just wooden and kenneth branagh doesn t succeed in convey the brash charm his charact probabl wa written to have the bottom line obvious plot one note perform unlik charact and grotesqu southern accent employ by british actor 
 
 
 
billi crystal normal bring the crowd to laughter but in this movi he and all the rest of them cannot bring ani smile on my face or perhap just one they call it comedi i say it s a wast of my time 
 
 
 
wow what a great cast julia robert john cusack christoph walken catherin zeta jone hank azaria what s that a script you say now you re just be greedi sure such a charismat bunch of thespian will weav such fetch tapestri of cinemat wonder that a script will be unnecessari you d think so but no america s sweetheart is one miss opportun after anoth it s like everyon involv woke up befor each day s write shoot edit and though you know what i ve been work pretti hard late and this is guarante to be a hit with all these big name right i m just gonna cruis along and let somebodi el carri the can so much potenti yet so pain to sit through there isn t a singl aspect of this thing that doesn t suck even julia s fat suit is lame

yes kazaam is one of those horribl bad movi that almost remind one of everyth that is wrong with not just kid movi but with human here we have shaq a a rap geni yes a rap geni where he doe everyth from make bad pun to dress in ridicul outfit all end in him in a christ like pose with lot of light surround him so yeah expect realli cheesi bit includ the first wish be a lot of junk food fall down from the sky and regrett not knock out the two main charact particular the kid what might not be expect is that a film with a kid and shaquill o neill would be so incred schmaltzi the main plot of the film involv this kid play in that all too typic and annoy kid fashion by the great grandson of frank capra where in which the kid is yell out his dialog angrili who come upon a geni who s been trap in a boom box then hiariti ensu a the kid make the shaq geni his quasi slave a he wait on his last two wish a he tri to make amend with his shadi gang type absente father this realli sappi contriv son and father stori would be bad enough a there are certain line that have been utter in a million other movi i e the two chanc in life speech from father to son but it s shaquill o neill who is both the reason to watch the film iron and the obvious sink crux of it all his plot line involv him when not get the over talki treatment from capra to rap within the dialog and also start off his blossom record career on top of this he also kick as and take name with the main bad guy who want him back in the boom box so is there a camp factor to the movi up to a point but this is even squash by all of the mushi scene and heart felt moment that have realli no busi with the rest of the materi one might ask if the peopl make the movi who were obvious do it at the behest of the popular of a basketbal player who want to go on the michael jordan act bandwagon if it would be anywher near decent entertain or convinc i d hope that they too knew they were just get paid but i d hope even more that they felt at least a littl guilti afterword for feed the shaq machin so if you want to have a fun night of shaq a geni turn rapper turn wisecrack all the more fun to you hell it might even be interest to have a shaq movi night with this and his other critic acclaim effort steel but if you re hope to keep a few brain cell stay away from what is veri like the worst flick of and a candid among mani other for worst of the s

review kazaam and say it s a bad movi isn t hard at all after all critic at the time it came out fell all over themselv excori this film say it wa among the worst film of the decad so the fact that i say it s bad or anyon el say it s bad is certain no surpris it s like someon talk about wwii practic no one say that wa a good thing right the question i have and no place on imdb can answer it is whi did they make this in the first place after all it s obvious to anyon who isn t sever brain injur that the film would be horribl but movi like ed a basebal play chimp cool a ice star the ever popular vanilla ice troll which doesn t even have ani troll in it babi genius einstain like superhero babi and pinocchio in outer space huh prove that ani idea no matter how dumb can make it to the big screen so the idea of the best basketbal player of the time star a a geni to an obnoxi littl brat seem downright normal the film start with a kid who is pretti jerki key the locker in the hallway of the school like the punk from free willi this kid is somehow misunderstood in other word a total brat and you know that no matter how selfish and horribl he is by the end of the film he ll have learn someth and grown just onc i want to see a punk kid like this end up in prison or or dead by the end of the film eventu while the neighborhood bulli are in the middl of pummel him the geni kazaam shaquill o neal is accident releas and insist on give the brat three wish but the kid doesn t believ him and the geni s magic seem a tad rusti eventu the brat doe realiz that kazaam is for real howev unlik most kid he withhold make his wish so in the meantim kazaam is forc to follow him around everywher like his own person servant and accord to the clich you know that by the end of the film max and kazaam will have becom lifelong buddi and a bunch of tear will be shed oh and max will have come to term with his absent father and mom s fianc i m gonna gag appar this geni is a bit of a social worker in addit to be a granter of wish a for kazaam shaquill speak in rhyme through much of the movi and even take a break to rap veri poor i m a middl age white guy and i think i could probabl rap at least a well he s an amaz basketbal player and i ve heard he s a nice guy but a rapper no way a far a his act goe he wasn t great but had such a nice person in the film that it s hard to hate him even if they made him do a lot of veri stupid thing so is the movi a excruci aw a you ve probabl heard through the first two third of the movi i would have said no shaquill seem to tri his best with an unlik kid and a bad script howev later in the film the bad becom horrid a kazaam seem too concern with himself to help the kid when he s realli need and out of nowher the plot get realli realli weird a the guy who want to make kazaam a rap star turn out to be an evil mobster and odd this guy seem to accept that kazaam is a geni with no hesit in addit the last portion of the film consist of peopl tri to kill max and his dad i know that the kid wa annoy but this is suppos to be a kid film what part of tri to kill the kid didn t the writer not understand then in an end that make this perhap the worst kid film end in histori kazaam becom god or someth and it all wa like a drug induc hallucin this end wa even dumber and weirder than the one in the black hole and boy did it make my brain hurt uggghh the horribl dialog wa just too much to bear overal it s a terribl film that is due most to writer who were certifi insan yes folk with a mess up messag bizarr non kid friend materi and horribl charact this is one wretch film sad given the idea and actor it s hard to imagin the final product turn out much wors by the way if you want to see a geni in a modern world film that is good tri the british made for tv film bernard and the geni a charm and except well written film from start to finish 
 
 
 
the onli reason i dvrd this movi wa becaus i live in cleveland and shaq play basketbal for u now and i ve alway heard how aw it wa the movi did not disappoint the best part were shaq s outfit the worst part were well just about everyth el my year old son and i just squirm and couldn t look at the screen when shaq start rap and we kept wonder whi max didn t wish for kazzam to fix that front tooth of his but for all it s terribl we just couldn t stop watch it the stori suck you in like a black hole or quicksand or a tar pit it wa hypnot but it wa worth it for the laugh and just to say that we actual watch kazzam 
 
 
 
this movi ha success prove what we all alreadi know that profession basket ball player suck at everyth besid play basket ball especi rap and act i can not even begin to describ how bad this movi truli is first of all is it just me or is that the ugliest kid you have ever seen i mean his teeth could be use a a can open second whi would a geni want to pursu a career in the music industri when even though he ha magic power he suck horribl at make music third i have read the bibl in no way shape or form did it say that jesus made geni fourth what wa the deal with all the crappi special effect i assur you that ani acn addl nerdi teenag with a comput could make better effect than that fifth whi did the end suck so bad and what the hell is a djin and final whoever creat the nightmar known a kazaam need to be thrown off of a plane and onto the eiffel tower becaus this movi take the word suck to an entir new level 
 
 
 
i wa given the book version of kazaam for my th birthday and peopl alway say the book version are alway better than the movi but this time they were wrong at least with the movi it s over soon the act in this is terribl which i expect from a film with shaq who play a magic rap geni that come out of an old ghetto blaster which there wa probabl a good reason he wa trap in there the kid in the film that play max is whini and a terribl actor he s bulli by neighborhood kid which i don t blame them becaus he s a littl douch bag the stori is just plain stupid and extrem clich about a boy who s father is alway work and never around who find a new friend who make his life better and eventu help him reconnect with his father even at year old i thought this wa a stupid idea it s a surpris ani of the peopl whom work on this film had career after ward becaus it s an embarrass and should have never been made i could rambl on even more about how this movi suck but you should alreadi know just by read the plot 
 
 
 
how a director of altman s experi could ever expect u to want to spend time with or to care about what happen to a lead charact who is neurot a whiner a jerk with no redeem qualiti that is the central puzzl about this profound confus piec of work a monstrous piec of trash in addit to this crippl flaw the plot line requir serious concentr to follow the setup that the branagh charact walk into is so obvious a setup from the start that we are inclin to wonder whether the writer and director have total lost respect for their audienc this latter issu is at the core of the film it repres directori self indulg with profound contempt for the tast valu and intellig of the viewer veri unusu for mr altman patrick watson
 
 
 
there s onli one thing i need to say about this movi the scene where shaq is in a music number with franci capra s charact about want to be a geni never see this movi the stori is horribl the act is terribl c mon it s shaq and i d rather see capra in free willi equal horribl twice befor ever see this movi 
 
 
 
i love the book jane eyr and have seen mani version of it all have their strong point and their fault howev this wa one of the worst i have seen i didn t care about jane or mr rochest charlott gainsbourg jane wa almost toler and certain look the plain part but she had no emot in ani of her line i couldn t imagin what mr rochest saw in her that bring u to mr rochest william hurt had even le emot than jane if that were possibl how two such insipid peopl could fall in love is a mysteri but it certain didn t hold my attent perhap the director zeffrelli fell asleep dure the product the timothi dalton too handsom for mr rochest version is far more faith to the book but ciaran hind play the perfect mr rochest in the a e version which is not all that true to the book tri to find someth posit about this movi geraldin chaplain wa perfect in her role 
 
 
 
this movi wa the first adapt of jane eyr that i ever watch and when i did so i wa appal by it so much of the novel had been left out and i consid william hurt to be terribl miscast a rochest sinc then i have watch all the other noteworthi adapt of the novel the three short version of and and the three mini seri of and and i have notic that there are wors adapt and wors rochest this is without doubt the most exquisit jane eyr adapt a far a cinematographi is concern director franco zerifferelli revel in beauti long shot of snow fall from a winter sky of lone rochest stand on a rock and of jane look out of the window but he is le good at tell a stori and bring charact to life in addit his script mere scratch the surfac of the novel by leav out mani import scene a a consequ the film doe not show the depth and complex of the relationship between jane and rochest and sad it doe also not includ the humor side of their intercours there are a number of short convers between rochest and jane each of them beauti stage but the coupl of sentenc they exchang do not suffic to show the audienc that they are drawn to each other we know that they are suppos to fall in love but we never see it actual happen the scene in which rochest want to find out jane s reaction to his dilemma by put his case in hypothet form befor her after the wound mason ha left the hous is complet miss and the farewel scene the most import scene the climax of the novel is reduc to four sentenc zerifferelli doe not make the mistak other scriptwrit have made in substitut their own poor write for bront s superb line neither are crucial scene complet chang and rewritten but he make the le offens but in the end similar great mistak of simpli leav mani import scene out what remain is just a glimps of the novel which doe no justic to charlott bront s masterpiec the cast is a mix bag while fiona shaw is an excel mr reed anna paquin s young jane is more an ill manner pout lolita than a lone littl girl long for love the ever reliabl joan plowright make a veri likabl but far too shrewd mr fairfaix and one cannot help feel that billi whitelaw is suppos to play the villag witch instead of plain look hard work grace pool charlott gainsbourgh a the grown up heroin howev is physic a perfect choic for play jane eyr look everi bit like thin and frail with irregular strong featur she come closest to my inner vision of jane than ani other actress in that role and dure the first minut of her screen time i wa enchant by her perform gainsbourgh manag well to let the audienc guess at the inner fire and the strong will which are hidden behind the stoic mask but unfortun the script never allow her to expand the more passion and live side of jane s charact ani further a a result of leav out so mani scene and shorten so much of the dialogu gainsbourgh s portray of jane must necessarili remain incomplet and therefor ultim unsatisfactori this is a piti a with a better script charlott gainsbourgh might have been a good a jane a zelah clark in the version but while it is still obvious that gainsbourgh is tri to play jane there is no trace whatsoev of rochest in the charact that william hurt portray hurt who ha prove himself to be a fine actor in mani good movi must have been awar that he wa physic and type wise so miscast that he did not even attempt at play the rochest of the novel his rochest besid be blond and blue eye is a soft spoken well manner nobleman shi and quiet slight queer and eccentr but basic good natur and mild he is so far from be irasc moodi and grim that line refer to these trait of his charact sound absolut ridicul addit dure mani moment of the movi hurt s facial express leav one wonder if he is fight against acut attack of the sleep sick particular in the propos scene he grimac like a patient ralli from a general anaesthet and is hard abl to keep his eye open if you compar his rochest to the strong will and charm protagonist of the novel simpli burst with energi and tempera it is no wonder that mani viewer are disappoint in hurt s perform still he offend me le than the rochest in the and version and i would in general rank this jane eyr higher than these three other one hurt obvious had the wit to recognis that he could not be the rochest of the novel and therefor did not tri to do so wherea georg c scott ciar n hind and tobi stephen thought they could but fail miser and i d rather watch a charact other than rochest than a rochest who is bad play and i d rather watch a jane eyr movi which leav out mani line of the novel but doe not invent new one than a version which use modernis dialogu which sound a if they could be utter by a today s coupl in a starbuck caf of cours this jane eyr is a failur but at least it is an inoffens one which is more than one can say of the and adapt i would therefor not desist anyon from watch this adapt you will not find jane eyr but at least you will find a beauti made movi 
 
 
 
i agre with one of the other comment writer about good stori good actor but mismatch and i would also say rush it ha been about year sinc i read the book a it wa in school but i felt that you would need to know the stori of jane eyr when watch this one a bit are left out therefor it doesn t fulli make sen for exampl jane mr rochest have hard spoken sudden he is propos marriag the actor don t have time to let the audienc know how their charact feel about each thing happen in the stori the actor are good but aren t given enough time to do this stori justic i m sorri to say it but i didn t realli enjoy this version the version with susanna york georg c scott would be the jane eyr movi of my prefer but you should check out the bbc mini seri version with zelah clark timothi dalton in the main role i love it so much i watch it regular there is an abridg version which goe for min or the full version for min 
 
 
 
jane eyre_ is one of the greatest novel in the english languag and this screenwrit should of read it i hate it when writer use spark note for what a novel is all about this movi is unbear to watch if you have read the book the whole red room is so down play that i wonder whi they even bother to put it in in the book the red room is foreshadow for the whole stori and the rest of jane s life helen burn is treat so bad in the movi i m sure she wa happi to die and leav earli in the book she is one of the most compel charact and she wa not the red head the whole christian theme is miss from her life and the rest of the movi do yourself a favor and miss this movi and read the stori a charlott bront master told it 
 
 
 
i don t like use the word aw to describ ani work of the cinema for which a great deal of time effort talent and money is spent in it creation but zefferelli s attempt to adapt charlott bront s novel jane eyr is a total wast of time the script is lack in fine and power everyth explain to the viewer in no uncertain term leav littl to the imagin the lead actor are woefulli miscast clear hire for their star name and the music score drippi and dull charlott gainsbourg and william hurt have absolut no chemistri with one anoth at all she is like a wet noodl wors even than joan fontain who at least wa capabl of some modicum of emot involv in what should be a stori of frustrat passion and william hurt act the entir film on one tone and that tone is flat and devoid of energi of cours the limp and vapid script doe not aid ani of these otherwis fine actor in their effort to bring ani whiff of life to this flick joan plowright s mr fairfax is like some disney creation who keep pop up to sweeten scene in which she would have been best left out there is no mysteri surround the stori of rochest s first wife the role of the would be second wife play like a barbi doll by ell macphearson is an empti cipher fiona shaw a veri great actress is complet wast a jane s aunt mr reed she would have been better cast a mr fairfax onli amanda root a jane s belov school teacher evok ani authent sympathi or believ i saw this version of jane eyr after view robert young s for british televis made in star ciaran hind samantha morgan and gemma jone there is no comparison young s vital romant and deepli move version is like an explod nova compar to zefferelli s wet squib i will be interest now to see the version with timothi dalton about which i ve read some veri good thing on this web site i am amaz at how mani peopl like zefferelli s yorkshir pictur book about all i can say good about this film is that the hous is beauti and the cinematographi vivid color beyond that it is a complet dud 
 
 
 
this version is pretti insipid i m afraid jane eyr is one of my favorit book and ha been sinc childhood but william hurt s weari throwaway act style is complet unsuit to the bold passion of edward rochest and poor charlott gainsbrough look like a bore petul teenag whose dental brace hurt i also can t believ that they elimin edward s great marriag propos scene from the end of the book one of the most move moment in literatur i do appreci that they final use such a young plain woman to play jane a charact who is suppos to be a world but if you want to see a version that closer approxim the person and passion of the novel plea see the s version with georg c scott and susannah york york wa too old tall and pretti to play jane but no one ha touch rochest s charact the way that scott did 
 
 
 
what made the idea of see this movi so attract wa the hope that it would live up to charlott bront s brillianc of the origin classic stori i wa deepli disappoint to find that this movi which seem to be either written or film in great hast had not the qualiti that made the origin novel so power much of the witti back and forth between the main charact jane eyr and mr rochest seem to be either miss from the screenplay or left on the cut room floor also miss wa jane eyr s charismat sen of self which enabl her to suffer through her turmoil and triumph over all the origin jane eyr wa a hero the woman in this movi did not seem to have much to triumph over includ one of the greatest part of the stori when jane run away from thornfield and mr rochest her struggl to find food and shelter her shame at have to beg for bread the threat of freez to death in the cold all to get away from a man she love were in my opinion poignant part of the stori that were simpli left out of this movi the titl charact seem dri and uninspir the stori wa unapp and for those who did not read the book i cannot imagin that this stori would be the least bit interest the screenplay and direct did littl if ani credit to the classic stori 
 
 
 
i can t say this is the worst film of all time but onli becaus there are still some movi i haven t seen yet this ha to be the most pretenti attempt at make a movi of all time the director suffer from the same issu he had with there will be blood though he wasn t quit a bad in that film the whole movi it feel like you re watch a guy tri to hard to impress beyond his abil it s like he sit in his littl director s chair and think how would a great filmmak handl this scene he just doesn t have it in him i don t know if this film could be save by a great filmmak there were certain some nugget of great that could have been polish but noth wa brought to ripen the scene where all the charact are sing wa the worst moment in cinema histori one by one a we see the charact sing and i squirm in my seat i kept say plea plea just don t have the guy on the brink of death sing too sure enough massiv failur

i can t tell you how angri i wa after se this movi the charact are not the slightest bit interest and the plot is non exist so after wait to see how the live of these charact affect each other hope that the past and a half hour were lead up to some signific finish what do we get a storm of frog now yes i understand the refer to the bibl exodus and the under theme but first of all it wa present with absolut no resolut and second of all it would be lost to anyon who ha not read the bibl a signific portion of the popul or charl fort a still larger portion a a somewhat well read person i thought this movi wa a self indulg poor imit of a seinfeld episod don t wast your time it would be better spent read well anyth to be honest
 
 
 
this wa shown on the biographi channel and wa about a inform a a child s comic i gave it out of for it s attent to detail becaus for the most part it had a s feel to it and the three ladi that play the origin three angel look like them so the make up wa good this wa suppos to be a biographi on the biographi channel but it wa void of everyth that is normal usual seen in one of their biographi no interview with surviv cast member crew member product team member etc or their friend famili and ani biograph of those peopl in fact i know just a much now about the programm a i did befor i watch this film that wa base on the suppos biograph book a for actual learn someth that no one knew about the program and wasn t common knowledg well that never happen

sad this is not the best british gore film sinc hellrais though the dvd cover claim this which is what trick me into buy it it is howev an homag to mani of the great horror of old film from most notabl the amicus stabl cradl is shot on mini dv which though we all know ha more of a tv feel than a movi can be done so much better everi scene set and shot look like it ha been lit in exact the same way standard key fill rear setup which onli enhanc the cheap look of the finish piec the gore content is quit frank laughabl from the open shot where we see a man s obvious foam rubber head torn apart through to tacki cheap prop hammer the creatur effect and the terribl cg there wa noth in there that impress me at all the act is abomin from the near comatos detect to the brummi dwarf via dani filth the least convinc horror movi bad guy i have ever wit each of the substori is more formula than the last and the set get wors and wors a the movi run look out for the mental asylum a georgian semi detach hous with a bad cg sign outsid and the most bizarr and not in a good way pad cell i have seen it took me four attempt to get to the end of the film without my attent wander nay run away at ani avail opportun i actual found myself dust at one point while the film wa run it doe howev mark one of the last known appear of emili booth s breast which i guess is one um two thing it ha go for it onc that s out of the way though it is all downhil i ve heard peopl say good thing about alex chandon and i would love to believ them but on this evid i m not like to if you want a decent homag to amicus avoid this and go for the leagu of gentleman christma special instead current battl it out with blair witch book of shadow for the titl of worst film i have ever seen 
 
 
 
it surpris had a plot i ve seen movi with le plot i don t wanna mention asian movi but i thought the camera wasn t bad at all for a cheap movi like this and also the atmospher wasn t too bad there is no real reason for most thing peopl do and the way they react to what happen although i do think that about a lot of movi in this case it wa horribl of cours it rip off some movi so bad just for singl scene the act wa bad but i ve seen wors the movi wa bad but i ve seen wors watch this film is an experi between boredom laugh fit death wish sadism horni and entertain on a low level so if you like gori movi with stupid plot this one is the right film for you i gave it becaus it can be entertain if you don t expect to see a good movi and you re in the right mood 
 
 
 
the director cut version which wa the one i saw wa veri long for this type of movi almost two hour is way too long if you have the choic definit go for the non director cut the main plot is almost not taken up at all the movi consist to the main part of sever murder scene which are connect but the feel is that they re onli shown in order to fill the movi with splatterish violenc the connect is not reveal until the latter part and the lack of context bore me out long befor i wa there a a horror movi it doesn t work you never get the requir feel for the charact due to mediocr act and the general disposit charact is present minut later charact is dead this pictur strong side lie in the splatter part 
 
 
 
this movi ha a few thing go for it right off the bat have dani filth a a lead actor is automat go to make some peopl like this movi admit i love cradl of filth and listen to the soundtrack to this movi long befor i watch it dani filth is a veri recogniz charact and make for a great lead the independ film style of the movi is great for the creepi factor there are some gorgeous actress in this movi for be low budget the special effect weren t bad either the way that peopl die were veri creativ and nightmarish now on to the con there is veri littl talk throughout this whole movi thus make for veri littl a far a charact develop it s hard to fear for the live of limp static charact when there wa a littl talk the f bomb wa abund pop up in random place yes i understand peopl swear but it seem like a preteen boy script this and thought himself cool for includ all the languag the storylin what i could make out of it wa pretti good although mani part are left dangl and the lack of convers leav one often wonder what s happen in the end cradl of fear is like a porno for peopl who love sex and violenc but like a porno tri to pull of a storylin it just doesn t work too well rent it though if you re a morbid person look to sate your blood and flesh appetit 
 
 
 
this movi wa made for fan of dani and cradl of filth i am not one of them i think he s just an imit ride the black metal bandwagon still i m general not a fan of black metal but a i wa carri this dvd case to pay for it i convinc myself that the le authent someth is the more it tri to be convinc thus i assum i m in for a roller coaster ride of rubber gore and do it yourself splatter with a sinist background now that is what i do like i got home and pop it in my patienc last minut aw camera work and disgust qualiti and that wa then that it look like it wa shot use a hi camcord i left it on the shelf mayb a nice even with beer and bmovi would creat a nice set for this pictur after a coupl of month i got back to it in mention surround and saw half then not onli the mention aspect annoy me my dislik evolv i notic how funni dani m height look in his platform shoe rip a head of a mugger apart yes rip his head appar had no skull i also found that this movi may have no sen still i haven t finish it yet so i wasn t posit after a coupl more tri i final manag to finish this flick a coupl of month back yes it took me year so dani in fact wa funni a satan manson super evil man s helper and the movi did not make sen see our bad person employ dani to do bad thing he deliv whi well i guess he s just veri veri bad a a matter of fact they both are and that is pretti much it we have a coupl of short stori join by dani s charact my favourit wa about a guy who steal someon s leg becaus he want to use it a his own yeah exact the act s rock bottom the cgi is the worst ever i mean stinger beat it and boy is stinger s cgi baaaaad the stori ha no sen and the qualiti is let s just say it is not satisfi the onli thing that might keep you watch is the unmotiv violenc and gore blood and gut are made pretti well whi you can actual see that the movi origin there and then move on exampl dani the man filth take a stuf cat fake a can be and gut it and then eat what fell out whi we never know we do know howev that this cat must have been on illeg substanc a his heart is almost half his size you might think after my comment that this movi is so bad it s good but it s just bad cradl of filth fan can add point i ad one for gore 
 
 
 
this film is a veri funni film the violenc is bad the act is well dani stick to sing or scream or whatev the hell it is you usual do the random chick wear hard anyth is just to catch sexual frustrat goth lad in person i think this movi realli doe suck the stori and charact could be veri good if say the direct the actor and other littl nibbi thing were made better but the film is just bad the onli reason whi peopl like this piec of crap is becaus it ha danni in it this film is possibl the worst b rate film ever and believ me that s hard to achiev especi when you re compet with def by temptat and over crappi excus for serious horror movi i m not a cof fan and so i just see this a anoth rubbish movi a realli bad one if dani made this a a comedi then good go him veri well done over than that though i rate it low for it s crappi watch it when you re in a happi happi joy joy mode so you can laugh at everyth or if you re high on multipl differ type of drug

let s see where to begin bad act i m not sure if i d even call it that a it more along the line of a no effort script read the actor didn t even seem to be into their part and seem quit lifeless and listless sure there wa a scene or two with nuditi but that couldn t save this movi from it s lifeless charact to call the main charact a rapper is an insult to the peopl who actual do the lyric had no rhythm or flow and seem more along the line of senseless rant budget did this movi even have a budget it seem like they use le money than i ve seen in a home shot youtub video bad light prop poor sound post product bad special effect if you want to go so far a to call them that stori could have been good if the peopl actual seem interest in make it so but there wa no life to this flick i don t care who direct it i ve seen some realli bad flick in the past year and this one is definit at the veri bottom don t wast your time or you ll be wish you listen to this unbias review check the rate you ll see the s are rapid outpac the fluf s with hard anyth in between wish i would have look a littl closer befor wast my time what a suck fest

i just finish a marathon of this seri and it becam agonis to watch a it progress from the fictionalis of the histor element to o herlihi s aw accent in later episod the show just slump the further it goe if you are look for some low qualiti product generalis ww fluff then i could recommend season but avoid anyth after that it degener into be one step from a soap opera with increas wors stori line and sensibl the old b w film is by far the best of ani form of entertain with the colditz name attach to it and even that is not what one could hope for 
 
 
 
what the hell of a d movi wa that bad act bad special effect and the worst dialogu storylin i ever came across the onli cool thing here wa coolio who had a nice cameo a a freak out cop howev the rest of the film is aw and bore it s not even so bad you can laugh about it just plain crap and whoever compar this to the evil dead seri might a well compar tomb raider to indiana jone well ok at least there wa angelina joli in tomb raider out of 
 
 
 
this movi is one of the worst horror movi i have ever seen from the veri first scene i knew it would be a smash crash it start with a seem bad girl kill a bunch of nun in a mission a it turn out the peopl in it were posse by some random zombi well some year later some colleg kid are pull some pledg prank horribl act goe from pledg to the head jock thing like the jock yell at him to do stuff in quit a non chalont manner with pledg over react and over do the whole eager to be popular role what realli took the cake with this one is the final battl absolut horribl special effect with the gun for exampl gun make a nois with no muzzl flash and vice versa this is accompani by stop anim zombi whi they move in stop motion is a mysteri cheesi music and about gun that come out of nowher overal this movi is crap just like so mani other you can rent for cent at your nearest low brow movi rental place 
 
 
 
this film wasn t program in italian cinema i have seen it at a manifest call fantafestiv i find it terribl becaus some scene seem like music video chaotic and dark the use of fluoresc color is ridicul and there s no suspenc in the film music is complet out of the stori and i don t have word to describ the visual effect if you look at the first scene the film seem to be interest but a few minut later it becom busi the stori is interest but the develop need a complet review 
 
 
 
in fact these young peopl were so distast that i couldn t wait for all of em to get slaughter and that includ clarissa joanna canton sinc i consid her the most annoy of the bunch but i knew it wa gonna be a mess from the open minut when a teen christin open fire on the priest and the nun with the lesli gore music play in the background it had nowher to go but down even the prosthet look fake and the blood look suspici like hawaiian punch although later on it took on red day glo look to match the silli halloween makeup they were all wear i m sure all the goth moron out there will appreci this bullsh t sinc it ll appeal to that bunch it sure didn t appeal to me blah and not even my favorit horror babe adrienn barbeau can save this stupid teen horror flick from itself she still look hot though i m glad she take care of herself sinc we don t get to see too much of her nowaday howev it is a step up from dant tomaselli s meander horror in that it ha a somewhat coher plot so i ll give it that much that and the littl boston terrier name boozer also bring it up a notch i like what boozer doe to clarissa in the end it wa the onli good scene in an otherwis silli film lion s gate film sure must have been desper when they pick this one up out of 
 
 
 
when i tell peopl that i review movi a a hobbi the first thing they say is what do you think of such and such movi there are a coupl of problem here first there is the probabl chanc that i ve not seen it and thus i ruin my reput second i could trash the movi in question without realis that it s actual their favourit last i could be given dvd to watch so they can judg my opinion thus i find myself sat befor the convent which is the sort of film i would ignor complet given the choic but unabl to avoid here more s the piti becaus this frank dread horror is about a scari a a box of kitten follow well worn clich s the convent focus on a bunch of american high school student on a trip to an abandon convent on a mission to get stone laid and mild spook but you ll never guess what happen next a group of cannibalist demon nun emerg from the cobweb who proceed to pick the kid off one by one in classic horror movi tradit will ani of them surviv and more import haven t you got better thing to worri about the onli thing that save the convent from be a total wast of time is the fact that nobodi is realli take this tosh serious with the except of coolio s bizarr cameo a a hyperact cop with an itchi trigger finger it s far too amus to be proper frighten the zombi cheerlead who make chipmunk nois for no reason the day glo paint job that appear when you becom a zombi but what realli kill it a a horror is the fact that you can instant tell when someon is go to jump out and get messili murder but even if they were tri i still doubt that it would work demon nun wear the sort of make up you d see in the buffi the vampir slayer tv show aren t realli that scari the scariest thing about this movi realli is that over of voter gave this a maximum score i mean i know it s funni but i hard split my side to be honest i ve had more fun in a dentist the convent isn t realli a horror movi a such it s more of a comedi horror like scari movi or shaun of the dead but you re laugh at it instead of with it i honest can t recommend this to anybodi except the famili of the cast and crew but even then i doubt veri much they d enjoy it i don t enjoy the so bad that it s good genr i person feel that if the film maker can t be bother to salvag a turkey then i shouldn t bust a gut tri to watch it yes it s a bad film and yes they realli should have gone home and done someth more construct a rubik s cube for exampl the dvd box ha two price sticker one for and a reduc price of but it wa sold for and that should tell you everyth you need to know about this poxi cheap awesom bad flick sorri if you do like it but the convent realli is a pile of unholi crap 
 
 
 
i thought that this movi wa pretti lame if you re look for cheesey you may like this i myself don t mind a fair amount of chees but this wa ridicul the progress of the movi bore me and the storylin wa veri weak the onli thing entertain about this movi wa the day glo zombi but even that isn t reason enough to see this flick 
 
 
 
i saw the trailer to this film and it look great so i went out and bought it what a mistak the act is a shambl the special effect if you could call them that look like someth that wouldn t be out of place at a school play some of the charact are so stupid in this film you will cring the minut they are on the screen which unfortun is all to often a for a stori forget it this is a warn don t wast ani money at all on this film it ha to be one of the worst thing i have ever seen if for some reason you like this film watch troll you will probabl enjoy that a well 
 
 
 
this is one of those movi that should have been way better than it turn out to be i dread to think what the blockbust approv edit must have look like becaus the director s cut on dvd wa a bore of the epic proport natur you don t expect it to be the godfath but an act class or two might have come in handi also there were so mani cute guy in this movi but they were woefulli under exploit i like watch a bevi of hotti writh around in their bvd a much a the next guy but even i have a right to expect a littl more it wasn t a total loss though at least we got a peek a drew fuller s cover junk and truli upset haircut and there s huntley ritter look even cuter than he did in bring it on and act about a well there s alway a silver line kid you just have to look realli hard for it and occasion you have to make use of your paus button 
 
 
 
this wa probabl the worst movi i have ever seen in my life it wa stupid there wa no plot and the special affect were ridicul and i have never seen such bad act in my life the onli good part about the movi were all the hot guy especi drew fuller i don t know what these peopl were think when they made this movi i didn t even want to finish the whole thing becaus you get to this point in the movi where the guy are all in bed touch themselv i mean it wa like some kind of sick and twist kiddi porn i would advis anyon who ha heard of this movi and wa interest in see it to just forget about it and find anoth movi to watch i wa veri disappoint the whole movi wa a complet wast of time in my opinion 
 
 
 
if you like to comment on film where the script arriv halfway the movi then this is the one a set and act a in a porn movi but noth is happen onli some grope and touch of the third kind which actual becom veri bore after minut of touchi feeli but no action a few of the actor i ve seen in real x rate movi and there their act then wa a lot better all the special effect are done by the great rondo whom perform all the magic whit his mind a cult movi is written on the box doe that mean that this film is not to be watch at all get drunk with some friend and watch this movi on new year eve ore thank give 
 
 
 
pro noth con everyth plot summari a femal report run into a hitchhik that tell her stori about the death of peopl that were kill by zombi review never in my life have i come across a movi a bad the zombi chronicl film on a budget of what look to be about buck tzc is a complet horribl horror movi that reli on lame forget actor whom couldn t act to save their live and gore that s more gross than frighten how doe a movi like this even get made simpli put avoid tzc like a sexual transmit diseas my last cent humor enough this movi wa made by a movi compani call brain damag film they re brain must have realli been damag to come up with a craptacular movi like this my rate out of if it were up to me this movi would get the rate of negat bajillion 
 
 
 
you can t hold too much against this know that it wa made in four day and i had expect it to be campi anyway it s not all that campi in realiti with the except of kevin kalish and huntley ritter who don t take themselv serious the rest of the cast play it halfway straight riley smith is except bad the ridicul stori is actual paid attent to which kind of shock me i assum the whole purpos with these ultra low budget horror movi wa to cater to the basest sexual fantasi and not give a damn about the stori but they use lot of word like technolog and physic in the script to get their point across although it s possibl that the stori is import onli to explain whi there s so few cast member nobodi care about this stupid storylin and the onli thing that are interest in the film are the mock of cult and the soft core homoerotic which aren t all that edgi i would have enjoy it more if there were just some random kill for no reason the film is graini with a tv qualiti look and act level there are a few sexi scene that are alright the boy writh in bed in their boxer feel themselv up or be tie down and make orgasm face while wine is pour on them and some of them are kinda funni and i like the dig at l ron hubbard and the intend ironi of a stori about religi cultist told with intens gay overton but it still isn t ani good 
 
 
 
i have been read the review for this movi and now i wanna kill my self i don t wanna live in a world where peopl find this move or rob schneider funni what is wrong with these peopl i m not angri at rob schneider becaus he ha the intellig of a dead cat i watch this film in disbelief who would pay money to make this this film is so bad that it pain most bad film are funni becaus they are crap the anim is just disgust watch this film and if you like plea for all of man kind kill your self we don t need you i want to rais money to get rob scheider off all movi if someon kill rob schneider they should be given a nobel peac prize 
 
 
 
guy is a loser can t get girl need to build up is pick on by stronger more success guy etc seen it saw it move on i d have to say that rob need to move past the adam sandler part of his life and get out of the adam sandler plot there are two funni part in the whole movi i couldn t even finish the last minut i wa get bore the anim is an alright film i do usual enjoy adam sandler film that have the same plot but this wa tri too hard to impress the joke are veri old so trust me this is not a film that most peopl could realli get into but some did so i ll be nice

i wa expect a movi similar to deuc bigalow which i enjoy howev this dud seem to last forev it s one of those flick which enjoy the sad placement of pg while not be kid appropri the joke aren t just low brow or f t joke they re crude lewd and mani act cross the boundari to not onli bad tast but beyond legal and moral decenc mani scene appear to have been chop to get the pg rate too bad it might have made a bigger splash a an r rate film if the funni wa left in overstat probabl i do not recommend this movi it is a full on wast of time and i m a movi lover and readi to give just about anyth a shot at minut in the movi felt like it should be wind down and boy were we readi for it to the end is quaint but doesn t salvag the rest of this quagmir tourist trap of a rental star glad i saw it a a freebi would have been sicken to pay hard earn greenback for this tripe 
 
 
 
ain t it hilari when an averag schmo lead a pathet life sudden ha someth outrag magic happen to him turn his life upsid down and caus him to learn a few valuabl lesson along the way that formula never get old doe it it s such a sure fire way to make a classic film just look at major hit like liar liar and big this must have been rob schneider s line of think when he made semi success deuc bigalow male gigolo and follow it with the anim sinc i ve alreadi trace the plot through sarcasm allow me to color it in more schneider play a loser cop who s sudden involv in a tragic accid but is save through surgeri by a loopi veterinarian who load him up with anim part caus him to whinni like a hors at inappropri time run like a cheetah etc this movi is slight more likabl than other schneider star flick such a anoth lame same plot follow up the hot chick but it almost feel like they want audienc to hate it by cast a realiti tv star a the romant lead colleen haskel from survivor and insert a cameo by norm macdonald my favorit scene just doe not exist sorri noth memor good except the product valu i just want to end this review by say that slight refer to other movi in a movi can be okay but when it come to line be deliv the exact same way you can do it there s a word for that milk actual here s anoth word cheap 
 
 
 
i believ that war film should tri to convey the terror of war avoid ideal and respect some rudimentari militari principl zvezda bare doe the first zvezda be a russian war film i wa expect patriot sentiment beauti poetic pictur a lush score slavic cheekbon and cruel german what i didn t need wa the naiv love non affair the unrealist silli war scene and the abus of the syrupi soundtrack in a film which avoid care all histor or polit refer stalin nazism holocaust onli to end on a pas but nonetheless insult to our sen of histori endnot about liber poland a miss opportun a a film but not a propaganda appar 
 
 
 
dreari schlocki just plain dread and aw let s be honest when you sit down to watch someth call the doubl d aveng you aren t expect great art or even mild mainstream entertain you are probabl expect a cult film type and mayb get some good look at some impress bust you don t get realli either of these in the video the stori a it consist with most of these type is inan kitten natividad run a local pub find out she ha breast cancer fli down to south america for a fruit that claim to be a panacea for ani ill and a super human abil giver return and fight dress a the doubl d aveng a group from a local strip club want to edg out the competit a stori go i have seen a lot wors but a anoth review note the execut is horrend the action sequenc lack zip drive motiv and are tissu thin the act isn t even proper campi and the dialog is the pit noth and i mean noth is funni from the winc pun to the heavi hand boob refer all could be forgiven if the girl could make up for it but they all fall way short kitten haji and raven de la croix are all quit older still love in their own way yet expo noth and becom the antithesi of what they are tri to be older campi caricatur of their former selv instead they look so lame and desper more becaus of the vehicl they are star in rather than their own abil there are some other love ladi but you realli do not see much of anyth pg definit could be an appropri rate for this the materi the actress and director are all tire tiresom and date and again not funni it wa a brutal hour plus sit through this and that is a shame a i wa expect someth campi and fun the guy play bubba by the way wa the onli real laugh for me not that he wa good at all mind you but everi time he open his mouth i kept think how truli aw he wa the lone bright spot here at all is see mr sci fi himself forrest j ackerman play the curat of a wax museum and chat to his wax frankenstein affection call franki other than that this is a complet bust now how is that for anoth tire dread trite pun 
 
 
 
this must have been one of the worst movi i have ever seen i have to disagre with anoth comment who said the special effect were okay i found them pretti bad it just wasn t realist and they were so fake that it just distract from the actual stori mayb that distract is the reason that i did not fulli understand the stori the archaeologist are look for the set they do not bother to tell what set or what is so special about it that also make it unclear whi they search for it in california while the intro of the movi take place in ancient egypt if you re shoot a movi that take place in the desert take the effort to actual go to the desert the begin the ancient ceremoni look like it wa shot insid a studio instead of a desert the action level wa constant throughout the movi no up and down no climax it made the movi look short and that s certain a pro for this particular movi 
 
 
 
i make a point out of watch bad movi frequent and the sci fi channel origin movi tend to be one of the best sourc for these movi you can find a such i m sure you can imagin my disappoint when i saw sand of oblivion the act wa uncharacterist sub par a oppos to the woefulli disgrac display sci fi usual ha in store for u there are a few cameo made by peopl you d most like recogn although you may not know their name by heart the cgi special effect are minim and a such one of the largest sourc of comedi in a sci fi featur is lack sure there are some funni moment like when a guy get behead by a bulldoz or when the main charact leav his friend to die in order to save a girl he s known for a coupl of day but overal it end up just not have you roll on the floor with laughter and i consid that a major disappoint if i wa rate it on a star scale made specif to judg made for tv movi i d probabl give it a mayb even a a real shame that i may have to wait till the next sci fi origin movi to get a good laugh and i realli hope that this movi isn t part of some overal qualiti increas in sci fi origin movi 
 
 
 
tv movi about an ancient egyptian cur brought to the u in the s dure the film of demill s first version of the command and which is reawaken when demill s set are unearth in the desert one of the worst film i ve seen in a long time the question is were the filmmak serious or kid when they made this film if this is serious it a laughabl bad movi and a great film to pick on for it bad if it a comedi it le good but funni for all of the wrong reason you will laugh long and hard at this film probabl more than mani other hollywood comedi 
 
 
 
watch the first minut of sand of oblivion gave me high hope it seem i wa in for a cheaper version of the mummi the setup wa promis in the s cecil b demill make his opus of the ten command it seem in use real egyptian artifact for the movi set they unleash an ancient and terribl evil don t they alway awar of what had been unleash demill order the entir set buri instead of the usual practic of tear it down hope the evil will be buri with it for all time then we switch to present day where a team is attempt to excav the site the movi s first mistak but hey those period costum are expens and this is a sci fi channel movi the first sight we get of the anubi monster are well done and it s a costum that they put some effort into and not the usual cheesi cg effect then the bodi count start this is were the movi went south for me the reaction to the fact that peopl are die in gruesom and strang way get a strang subdu reaction onc they realiz that the ancient evil ha again been unleash and is on a kill spree what do the stock issu lead man and ladi do they make the usual stop to the guy who know the truth but never told anyon after get that vital inform do they share it with the comrad at the dig site no they stop off at a hotel for a refresh shower and some pleasant small talk realli i m not the most motiv person but if i knew a demon from ancient egypt wa on the loo and kill everyon in sight and would be come after me i d put a littl hustl in my step to solv the problem after this overlong and pointless middl section they get around to destroy the anubi monster in the usual way by race around in dune buggi and shoot it with a rocket launcher while it s stand by a pile of phosphor grenad for a sci fi movi it wa abov the usual crap they put out which isn t say much at all what disappoint me is this could have been a lot more if someon had wrote a decent script for it 
 
 
 
while the idea is more origin than most sci fi movi the execut is a usual lack while the practic mummi effect are not bad and the gun nut charact is over the top giggl induc the onli real draw is to see morena baccarin and adam baldwin reunit on the small screen i suspect that wa the idea all along they do the best they can with what they have but the must see moment for me were in the first minut or so when morena s charact sport some tomb raider style short not high brow cinema i know but you can t deni true beauti when you see it and adam baldwin onc again ham it up a the guy you love to hate if you just want to watch a coupl of your favorit firefli charact have a good time with some sub par materi then this might be for you if you want good act and charact develop then be advis to look elsewher 
 
 
 
review for this film were lukewarm at best while expect were sky high a big budget ton of popular face a rather funni idea and a main actress everyon love the end result is a disast alic tremblay s suppos humor journey in fantasi world fail in everi way to entertain it s audienc i didn t hear a singl laugh throughout the entir present go through it s page thin stori line and one dimension charact without a singl spark not a sign of the magic it wish it had the minut of film here are steril with clumsi direct and some good actor do their best to come of a profession in a featur that certain couldn t seem that great an idea on the set let alon on paper l odyss e d alic tremblay is a collag of comic sketch link togeth with a veri thin layer of good idea avoid or boredom will haunt you 
 
 
 
this movi wa the beatliest mormon movi made yet it made the rm son of provo look like well done film it wa suppos to be funni from what i wa told the best part wa the best actor in the movi travi eberhard if he wasn t in the movi it probabl wouldn t have been made he rule it wasn t funni it wa beat it had thurl big t bailey who s charact made no sen it wa made in provo it didn t make fun of brokeback it had larri h miller in it it wa the st movi clint howard wasn t funni in gari coleman chose the perfect movi a comeback they should have cast at surreal life audit it wa made by halestorm entertain 
 
 
 
well i suppos the good news concern william winckler s opus the doubl d aveng is that it manag to unit three of rus meyer s mammarian marvel kitten natividad haji and raven de la croix in one pictur i can onli assum that lorna maitland tura satana and babett bardot were busi the week they shot this thing or el manag to see a copi of the script in advanc the bad news though and there s plenti of it is that this film if it can even be call that have been shot straight to video is a complet misfir a total abort an out and out atroc an absolut abomin and truli one of the worst pictur that i have ever seen look no further for the lamest superhero movi ever made the plot here such a it is deal with kitten gain superpow after fellat the rare cockazilla plant in south america to cure her breast cancer oy and later battl a trio of megalung bikini dancer back in l a too bad that everi lame boob joke trot out fall complet you should pardon the express flat that there is zero actual nuditi in the film at all other than some old photo of kitten in her heyday and that some shave cream and a papier mach boulder are the sum total of the special fx the meyer gal here are a bit long in the tooth saggi in the chest to put it kind although sheri dawn thoma a bikini girl ooga boobi doe manag to uh stand out nice so whi have i given this juvenil unfunni fail embarrass of a movi star instead of to be succinct joe bob brigg his voic over commentari in the special featur of the dvd i just watch is absolut hilari especi when he pull out around synonym for the word breast from the on his web site s canon hooter list the man is a nation treasur and he manag to upgrad this skeet of a disc to coaster status 
 
 
 
this movi is a total dog i found myself strain to find anyth to laugh at just so i wouldn t feel like i d total wast my money and my time the write in this film is absolut terribl it s a shame it s not up to the standard of other hale storm movi they should have save the money on get d list actor like fred willard and gari coleman and spent the money work the script until it wa right even gari coleman wasn t proper util for his role this movi leav you wonder what the point of most of the plot wa includ the subplot after view this movi i m left with the impress that the produc were hope to captur some kind of napolean dynamit like humor where it s not so much the line a the charact and the deliveri unfortun this movi fail to deliv the line the charact the deliveri or the humor i should have gone to the dentist instead 
 
 
 
first of all let me say the i am lds or rather i am a mormon so when i watch this film i automat gave it the benefit of the doubt i can usual find someth redeem in everi movi i watch and this one wa no except it doe have it redeem moment but they are few and far between one of the first thing i notic that bother me veri great wa that it seem a though halestorm wa asham of our church in the lds church congreg are call ward and the basketbal court is in the cultur hall never onc are either of these two name mention the church is never refer to by name and the standard is a far a it goe in mention what our church believ it make me wonder if the director are realli lds or lds wannab this film had so much potenti it could have realli shown our church in a posit light and help the public to see not onli what we have to offer but also what we believ instead it wa onli mild entertain and left much to be desir if i were not alreadi lds i d be left think mormon are stupid idiot and asham of their belief it is not a film i will recommend to my nonld friend sorri halestorm you can do better than this 
 
 
 
everi onc in a long while a movi will come along that will be so aw that i feel compel to warn peopl if i labor all my day and i can save but one soul from watch this movi how great will be my joy where to begin my discus of pain for starter there wa a music montag everi five minut there wa no charact develop everi charact wa a stereotyp we had swear guy fat guy who eat donut goofi foreign guy etc the script felt a if it were be written a the movi wa be shot the product valu wa so incred low that it felt like i wa watch a junior high video present have the director produc etc ever even seen a movi befor halestorm is get wors and wors with everi new entri the concept for this movi sound so funni how could you go wrong with gari coleman and a hand of somewhat legitim actor but trust me when i say this thing went wrong veri wrong 
 
 
 
i wa not expect much go in to this but still came away disappoint this wa my least favorit halestorm product i have seen i thought it wa suppos to be a comedi but i onli snicker at or joke is it realli a funni gag to see a fat guy eat donut and fall down over and over what wa up with the janitor in heaven scene fred willard ha been hilari with some of his christoph guest collabor but this did not work they must have spent all the budget on get known actor to appear in this becaus there wa no light budget it look like it wa film with a video camera and most scene were veri dark doe it realli take that much film to show someon actual shoot and make a basket a oppos to cut away and edit a ball swish through a basket i tri not to be too critic of low budget comedi but if you want to see someth funni go to a real church basketbal game instead of this movi 
 
 
 
wow what can i say i like shiti movi and i go out of my way to watch a corni action flick but snake eater i would have rather had a nail driven into my pee hole while my grandma gave me a lap danc lorenzo lama pfft more like lorenzo lameass this guy ha a much act abil a bill clinton ha self control it ha all the good to make a realli bad movi even wors craze hillbill yep needle tit shot with a real weird scar yep crappi soundtrack yep i wish i could give the movi star but is a low a it goe serious i think someon wa play a joke on me when i saw this it cant be real the wors thing there is more snake eater movi guess it in demand 
 
 
 
first of all i becam dissi after watch this movi for five minut caus of the ba screenplay i don t think this movi ha ani purpos it s bore from the first minut to the last i don t understand whi this movi score so high i gave it but actual it s not more wurth then 
 
 
 
i go to the cinema to be entertain there is absolut noth entertain about this film from begin to end there is no respit from the gray grind realiti of this woman s life it is one pace with no chang of mood i remain until the end onli becaus i wa convinc that thing must get better they don t and i don t think i wa the onli one a evidenc by the mani groan ring around the cinema a the film drew merci to a close honest depict social deprav is no crime but bore your audienc to groan is not the way to win the sympathi of the public a dread film 
 
 
 
hard to describ this one if you were a fan of rus meyer film back in the day you will sure be plea to see that haji is still look realli hot though forri ackerman ha not fare so well what is he do still make these movi anyway if i go up to him with a camera will he be in my movi it wa a pretti fun premis a superhero whose giant mammari are her secret weapon but sometim it did not pan out for the whole length and the joke were on a level with your averag joe e brown comedi or abbott and costello if that s your thing basic just bad pun still i found this movi fascin to watch and for more than reason good job but still a fundament flimsi product 
 
 
 
if i had known this movi wa film in the exasper and queas induc dogm style i would never have rent it nevertheless i took a dramamin for the seasick and gave it a shot i last a veri veri veri long forti minut befor give up it s just bore pretenti twaddl the last french movi i saw wa romanc and it too wa pretti dismal but at least the camera wa steadi and not breath down the neck of the charact all the time i am baffl at the continu popular of dogm oversea it ll catch on in america about the same time a the next big outbreak of leprosi it s call dogm becaus that s the averag number of time the actor are poke in the eye by the camera 
 
 
 
i have no idea what idiot gave this movi a palm d or at the cann film festiv becaus it wa atroci i actual watch the entir thing simpli becaus i couldn t believ that someon would make such a worthless film there is noth interest about the plot the charact are devoid of depth and there is no attempt at give ani sort of ambianc with music or sound effect also if you do decid to wast hour of your life by watch this film be sure to bring someth to throw up in becaus the cinematographi is simpli someon run around with a hand held camcord and half the time you can t even see the main subject this style ha been use much more success in movi such a blair witch becaus it creat suspens in rosetta there is no plot and no suspens to which that style would lend anyth i should have known better when it came on at o clock in the morn that it wa go to be horribl 
 
 
 
i hate how this movi ha absolut no creativ input i know they re go for realism but to be frank i just don t want realism realism is bore if i want to see daili life i ll uhm live tell me an interest stori and we ll talk i can deal with the low product valu hell i m a sucker for low product valu but at least work in some good idea the direct onli goe a far a grab a camcord and walk around a bit but obvious i m suppos to dig that becaus it make stuff so much more realist hitchcock use to say drama wa essenti life with the dull bit cut out i can onli conclud this is not drama not by a long shot we get to see rosetta walk to someplac rosetta work in a bakeri rosetta eat a waffl rosetta carri around bag of far rosetta walk back home rosetta walk someplac it s just not that entertain there isn t realli a deeper mean either i got so bore i start look for some reflect on life in this movi but it s just plain realism the most overr qualiti in the busi i guess i m suppos to love this but come on there s noth in there 
 
 
 
this rubbish excus for televis is the singl most god aw piec of trash ever to hit australian televis the hous mate are dull uninterest ridicul unintellig and are pick on the basi that you would be like to attempt to murder them if you had to live with them a far a i am concern big brother is the declin of western societi show how u a a societi are on a steep slope to becom brain dead moron whatev happen to televis that didn t target the lowest common denomin of societi a an audienc this cannot be classifi a entertain i think that it true that channel ten can remov your soul it happen to rove mcmanus who wa onc a respect comedian and onc move to channel becom horribl unfunni with the except of the simpson which is high intellig made 
 
 
 
if there wa a star rate i would glad hand it out to this absolut horrid pile of wast the fact that the actual summari is perfect fine and that if it had been made differ it could have been brilliant onli make it wors the basic task of lock up a group of peopl in an experi chamber is fine but where the experi all i see is a bunch of unintellig surfer and blond chat about music and cultur i don t know or want to know about the challeng are pathet and silli the whole point of realiti tv is to show realiti if you set a challeng don t make them play with exagger prop of food and stereotyp cultur element in friday night game make them do an actual challeng and a for earn prize money that fine if they actual earnt it these peopl are nut if onli they would make the show better the actual idea would be glorious but that ain t gonna happen 
 
 
 
i bought this movi from gamestop s discount use movi bin and the cover caus me to laugh uncontrol so i bought it for cent the movi itself is retard and they use like ten differ monkey throughout the whole film that hard look alik not to mention they use a stunt doubl who is just a short guy in costum make a desper attempt to imperson a monkey the director more than like commit a murder suicid with the chimpanze after the movi debut in a preview for some other low rent warner bros film and he end up owe money to the studio it also doesn t help that he wasn t even infam for the terribl job he did he wasn t even known for produc a poop chute film whi wa this movi ever made 
 
 
 
i watch this a few day ago so detail are get hazi the film is shot on hand held camera and a lot wa made of this at the time it wa releas origin sinc we hadn t had mani studio pictur made in this way i can t help but feel this wa more of a gimmick than anyth design to make the audienc think that what we are see on the screen hasn t had all the compromis that come with a big budget and so wa more real howev what we have here isn t much more than a not a good rip off of the first half of full metal jacket so anyon who ha seen that or ani one of the other rip off there of will know what to expect the main problem i had wa the stereotyp charact with the weedi soft kid out of their depth close harmoni sing ebon spout black dude world weari sergeant bitter and twist psycho etc etc all be put into the sort of situat that would provid the most friction and tension at ani given time mayb this wa intent to highlight the stupid and injustic of the situat mayb it wa lazi or mayb it wa just a committe tri to appeal to the biggest audienc all i know is it wa annoy one novel thing wa the mixtur of volunt and drafte where normal all the charact would have been forc into the situat although onli the scene between the two main charact realli make much play of it this seem to be the main pivot of the plot with the volunt come to their sen and the drafte gain a sen of duti and self worth but it all done in a rather forc and unsubtl way the other big bug i had wa how all the charact with the except of the psycho and the real softi would react to each inevit conflict with at first aggress and threat of violenc face with farrel s ubiquit stoicism immedi back down and be all reason and diplomat i guess if i had to find a plus it would be the act from the two lead which wa strong and veri convinc tho consid the formula natur of the charact this wasn t too hard in my imagin bozz grew up to be zeke off tour of duti and for my money episod of that would be more fun to watch 
 
 
 
ouch they don t come much wors than this horrid adapt of c s lewi s belov novel while the adapt is veri true to the novel the act is simpli aw and the set and special effect are on a scale equival to a school play i ve read that the budget for this miniseri wa the grandest that the bbc ha ever given at the time but sure they could have scrape togeth a bit more than the that it look like this wa film for the worst effect of all is mr beaver i know comput effect weren t at the level necessari or even cost effect at the time but the costum store man in a suit look wa horrid better to have just cut the charact from the film than do that to the role avoid this at all cost

i wa unlucki enough to have seen this at the sidewalk film festiv sidewalk a a whole wa a disappoint and this movi wa the final nail in the coffin be a devout fan of lewi carrol s alic book i wa veri excit about this movi s premier which onli made it that much more uncomfort to watch normal i m enthusiast about modern re tell if they are treat well usual it s interest to see the parallel between the past and present within a familiar stori unfortun this movi wa le of a modern retel and more of a pop cultur pervers the adapt of the origin s charact seem juvenil and usual prove to be horribl annoy it probabl didn t help that the actor weren t veri good either most perform were ridicul over the top which i assum wa either due to bad direct or an effort to make up for a bad script i did not laugh onc through out the durat of the film all of the joke were outdat refer to not so current event that are sure to lose their poignanc a time goe by realli the onli highlight of the film wa the open sequenc in which the white rabbit is on his way to meet alic but even then the score wa a poor imit of danni elfman s work also i d have to say that the convers of the croquet game into a rave danc off wa aw it wa with out a doubt the low point of the film what a joke don t see this movi after it conclus i wa genuin angri 
 
 
 
a friend onc told me that an art hous independ film ran in a cinema when upon the close of the film audienc were so enrag they preced to tear up the cinema seat of cours my imagin ran amok tri to conjur up the content of such a piec of work well now my imagin can be put to rest i am a lifelong andrei tarkovki fan and an ardent admir of his work i have come across mani peopl who thought tarkovski s film are slow move and inert opinion be what they are i found this not to be true of the late director s wonder work which are wrought with mean beauti composit and complex philosoph question upon hear aleksandr sokurov call the heir to tarkovski i wa excit to experi his film with the except of the open air ride through the field stalker this movi ha no kinship to anyth tarkovski ha done it doe not seem to posse the slightest mean even on a complet mindless level it s suppos gorgeous stark cinematographi is devoid of ani composit craft there is a no balanc no proport and the exposur meter seem to be run low on batteri in the freez snow the main charact is so inept and indecis it make you wonder whether his father might have been aliv if he made up his mind sooner i am also not advers to non plot or stori line that progress on multipl non linear fashion but there isn t even a non stori here one must sure enter the view of this film with a shave head if one were to exit it with noth gain and noth lost a hair pull would be the onli possibl answer to a pace that could make a tarkoski time sculptur look a if jerri bruckheim had film a charli chaplin short i won t rule out that this may be one of sokurov s stinker tarkovski s solari but to conclud that he is one of tarkovski s heir base on this film would be to call pari hilton the successor to aristotl c mon guy don t be afraid to say it no amount of big impress word is go to magic bring this corp of celluloid back to life i don t profess to fulli understand russian cultur and i probabl don t have russian valu but i immedi pick up on tarkovski s work a someth magic a treasur and a gift to viewer if it didn t have sokurov s name on it and it air on say saturday night live i m pretti sure nobodi would read all these magnific analysi into this wet noodl of a flick

perhap i m out of date or just don t know what electra is like in current public but the electra that i read wa far more manipul and alway seem to have a plan she usual use other to do her dirti work and more often than not some sort of doubl cross wa involv just when you think you have it all figur out she pull the wool over your eye and get her way this movi wa fair weak on the dialog the act wasn t particular convinc and the action wa spotti i wa realli look for someth more along the line of frank miller s book electra assassin which is much darker than anyth in this movi special effect where cool action wa interest at time but more often than not the stori and plot wa slow or illog tha hand wa not menac enough and electra wa not bitchi enough she s the girl you love to hate but in this stori i just didn t care either way 
 
 
 
this wa no trainspot or guy ritchi film it wa a big wannabe it want to be an edgi nervous laughter urban life affirm film but it s more of a camera jerki mess it s a lot easier to imit someth el than to creat a real stori with real charact from the begin i couldn t care le about the charact or what they were involv in they were alway alway hit piss or cri on each other onli there wasn t ani substanc to what they were do the dialog between charact is meant to be hip reveal instead it come out trite and one scene after anoth is predict i know there are viewer out there that realli like this movi so i could be wrong 
 
 
 
i m irish and i ve been live in denmark for a while so i wa look forward to go home last week so i could see intermiss and i will go on record a say this film is aw it is not quit a bad a someth like the most fertil man in ireland but it definit doe not stand up there with other irish film such a the commit i went down or michael collin some aspect of the film are actual quit funni such a colm meaney american style garda but the film itself is shot complet wrong the bounc around of the camera and the constant zoom in zoom out tri to give the film an edgi look a if it were a gritti drama but it isn t this is an irish lock stock and two smoke barrel and it should be shot like this it should have smooth movement from one shot to the next the film just look sloppi and thrown togeth the perform are okay given the aw script a friend of mine said to me like it wa like they just follow colin farrel around dublin for a week he give a decent display a a dublin dirtbag but it no way compar to his perform in minor report tigerland or phone booth the best perform wa from dierdr o kane who play a sexual frustrat middl age woman who ha just been dump by her bank manag husband for a younger woman i think she should leav her god aw stand up and focus more on her act all in all it doe in no way live up to the expect put on it by the irish press or deserv to be even consid a one of the best irish film ever i m expect a backlash from these comment becaus most peopl i have spoken to have said it wa great but befor you repli ask yourself would think so high of this movi if it wa set in england or america 
 
 
 
a terribl film which is suppos to be an independ one it need some depend on someth this total miser film deal with the interact among irish peopl were they tri to imit the wonder film crash if so this film crash entir there is just too much go on here culmin by a littl brat run around and throw rock into buse and car which obvious caus mayhem the film is just too choppi to work one woman lose her husband after year to anoth while her younger sister is rip off by a suitor this caus the former sister to becom a bitter vetch and walk around in cloth not worth believ the older sister also becom embitt but soon find romanc then we have loser who purchas mask to rob a bank obvious the robberi goe awri but there doesn t seem to be ani punish for the crook perhap the punish should have been on the writer for failur to creat a cohes film 
 
 
 
i live in ottawa where this film wa made and i realli wish it hadn t been this is one god aw flick i realli tri and support independ film but there is this stigma attach to anyth indi and that stigma is indi film blow well this film doe noth to shed this cur the actor writer director brett kelli doe littl to contribut to the genr rather he re hash tire clich s from movi past i am realli tire of menac evil look charact that lurk in the shadow and prey on the unsuspect it s way too overdon i can rememb one scene in particular right near the end of the flick where the whole scene is lit with car headlight now some may say that this wa an effect use to creat mood and tension but sad it wa to showcas the shoestr budget of this movi a well for a movi that dare to call itself horror a viewer will find themselv hard press to find ani actual gore other than a few scene with corn syrup and red food colour the biggest thing that drag this film down is the pace and the lack of charact develop the basic plot is that child are be kidnap and the parent must track down this bonesett fellow befor a certain time in order to get their kid back not that this concept bug me but i didn t realli find it believ that when the two main charact both who have lost child can find time to make out with each other this is done in such a short time span that it s inconceiv my first prioriti would be to get my daughter back and at least get to know the ladi befor make out with her the last point that i have is and i won t hold this against kelli but the movi is shot entir on bore emotionless video and that realli take away from ani ten moment that would have just ooz style on film although if this movi were given a million dollar makeov and redon the stori and bore act and lame everyth could not keep this movi afloat my onli hope is that someth happen to prevent brett kelli from make a sequel which ha been report on his websit a sequel that wa half written in one sit lord help u all 
 
 
 
usual when a movi receiv a vote of one it is becaus someon simpli dislik it and is annoy it doesn t have a lower rate and so decid to drag it down a much a they can instead of just give it a low rate this is not the case here bonesett is a perfect exampl of a film it doe noth right and it doesn t have the chanc to becaus it doesn t realli attempt to do anyth there are strand of a bad d d novel kind of plot which doesn t hold togeth and a complet lack of ani kind of act throughout it is clear that nobodi involv in this project gave it ani kind of serious effort becaus even a complet patent untal person hard work would amount to more a truli aw film 
 
 
 
i realis that the u armi wa demoralis by but this film wa unbeliev it wa suppos to be a train camp not the s punish battalion in a sven hassel novel the writer must be a real armi hater the psycho sergeant who kept beat the crap of peopl belong in a prison cell and the useless black top sergeant should have been sack a well these men were go oversea the receiv unit would sure have wonder where all the unus damag recruit were come from and an investig would have ensu the scene that blew it complet wa the electrocut one farrel the alleg barrack room lawyer would have had the instructor over a barrel for issu an illeg order to tortur pow in contravent to the geneva convent actual assault on an enlist man sexual assault and conduct unbecom an offic intead he just walk away after this disciplin brake down into a madhous level and the film becom unwatch i don t know how it end i went to bed 
 
 
 
movi had some good act and good moment though obvious pretti low budget but bad rate due to basic premis be bad develop the main point of conflict between the two lead doesn t play out in a realist manner at all there are a few scene where they disagre becaus of it but no discus of ani great depth that would explain how they can be togeth while see the world so differ especi sinc the employ of glenn is so wound up in this part of his life and adam is activ enough with his that he support it with time and money also sever time glenn is portray negat for be the way he is apolog to adam for his past while adam is shown to be upstand and tradit which the film proclaim to be the good way in the end i don t like be preach to like that i attend a discus session with the director after view ltr and he said that he present this conflict between them becaus if he wa in glenn s shoe and he said he doe in real life relat to glenn s view that he could never date someon with adam s view well then i think he should have done a much better job explain how glenn could do it in the film also director said he direct this his first movi onli after read direct for dummi direct wa not that bad but far from a top notch effort i ve seen wors but i rare leav film feel this frustrat 
 
 
 
when i saw that mari louis parker wa associ with this epic novel turn film i wa intrigu be a fan of the book i assum she d be play toni roz or chari but more so i wa intrigu to see how they would turn this veri head y almost psycholog but not psycholog thriller novel in to a movi that would be access to those who hadn t read the novel and that would be at least mild satisfi for those who had the book is a complex reflect of societi woman and modern life and i wa interest to see how they use the differ narrat that lead to the unfold of the stori in a film what they actual did wa a crime the biggest error and confus issu is whi would oxygen a network that advertis a be for woman take an amaz book about how complex wonder and terribl woman are and can be and chang the protagonist from woman to some dumb former cop with no real motiv to be involv in the stori it seem like whoever adapt it took an easi way out by use this guy to straight up ask roz toni and chari about how they knew zenia and in do that they rush through bulk of the book in do this though they muddi the stori and cut everyth that is great about the charact in it asid from make it so the audienc had no one credibl to associ with in the film these woman aren t peopl they are charact in the book zenia doe fake her death but the book mention it to get this point across while the film wast minut focus on this former cop run around and do noth of use they tri to make this complex book an episod of law and order or csi it turn out that mari louis parker play zenia which wa so wrong zenia is a catherin zeta jone angelina joli or mayb even a scarlett johnasson type she is a woman men can t not ador and a woman that woman are intrigu and threaten by but in a keep your enemi closer kind of way and onc she get closer she seem total genuin and trust worthi despit your better judgment she s the kind of woman who even when she lose she win she s alway still beauti still rich and there are alway still peopl out there who don t know her game in the film zenia didn t take chari s man the blond american draft dodger who wa use chari in the first place but instead took august and tri to becom her legal guardian and appar came back to be her lesbian lover a a linger kiss at the coffe shop impli and zenia did kill the chicken befor leav with august but it made no sen sinc all of the build up to it wa remov it s wa a if whoever wrote the screenplay wa grasp at straw to satisfi those of u who read the book but i think had i not read the book i would have spent the whole movi confus if i had bother to stick with it at all and roz s husband wa dead befor zenia came in to the pictur which wa weird sinc zenia took roz s busi and home life in the book which is whi roz hate her so much and she and zenia had conspir to kill roz s husband year and year back and accord to the film toni and west had been date forev even at the parti where zenia and west in the book had paint the whole place black and they made toni seem like this total with it and evil bitchi person who wa alway respect by everyon for her intellig and popular for it toni s charact wa so wrong in this film she seem a littl psycho and like the mastermind behind whatev conspir wa go down a oppos to the kind of gawki mild reclus teacher that she wa in the book the film basic impli smart woman are evil beauti woman are evil power woman are evil and woman who teach yoga are off their rocker they basic tri to make it so zenia wasn t necessarili a aw a she wa in the book and then in the end the three woman convinc this former cop who of cours in the process of research this meet zenia and ha an affair with her that is suppos to end with them move to barbado or someth ridicul which of cours zenia bail on to hide zenia s bodi which they found splat at the hotel she wa stay at but the film impli that one of the three woman push her over the balconi or they conspir togeth to do it and then zenia also manag to take all of roz s money in the process by the end of the film i wa onli half pay attent between commerci b c it had spiral so far out in space from what it could and should have been if you aren t confus by this breakdown of the film then mayb you would like it becaus i have read the book and seen the movi and from the movi alon i am ridicul confus it wa terribl i get that make a film out of that book is quit a task but if you are go to take on the task you should start by determin what in the book is unnecessari instead of creat some useless charact to be our alic in wonderland are there realli no fluffier book that oxygen could be make at least half decent tv movi of

shown in australia a hydrospher this incred bad movi is so bad that you becom hypnotis and have to watch it to the end just to see if it could get ani wors and it doe the storylin is so predict it seem written by a high school dramat class the set are pathet but margin better than the miniatur and the act is wooden the infant muppet seem to have been stolen from the prop cupboard of total recal there didn t seem to be a singl origin idea in the whole movi i found this movi to be so bad that i laugh most of the way through malcolm mcdowel should hang his head in shame he obvious need the money 
 
 
 
there are two reason whi i did not give a to this movi one reason are some of the actor like malcolm mcdowel and gwynyth walsh work who tri to play at their usual good level of act howev at mani scene they were somehow block by the bad script the other reason is the cool idea and look of the cyborg which is quit differ to most other such role i ve seen so far everyth el in this movi is a bad a it can be bore scene useless and bore dialog bad script work and it seem a it wa the first movi ever for mani actor it could have been an interest stori though but they fail complet 
 
 
 
this is one of the worst written movi i ve ever had to sit through the stori s noth new but it s a cartoon so who care a long a it s pretti and fun i m not go to go a deep a the characteris or i ll be here all day except to say that there aren t ani the charact chang person whenev it s conveni to the plot but whoever wrote the script and visual direct should be forbidden access to so much a pencil and paper thumb down i d vote to cut their thumb off narrow in on an object prop cut back to charact close up charact give a know look which the audienc will not even remot understand repeat that sever time with differ object prop make the charact pay no attent at all the huge lump of rock are float around crash into each other general rain destruct all over and which could kill them all at ani moment but make them stop and gasp in fear when they see a harmless look almost pastor green rock in the distanc the whole thing is a long success of event action and behaviour that are onli there for the conveni of the writer to save him have to think or make ani effort at all to write the stori proper this is the plan of cg cartoon except that it doesn t have ed wood groan factor to make it fun to watch do yourselv a favour spend your cartoon budget on pixar movi

when i saw this movi i heard all the hype and i heard how peopl said that denzel deserv the oscar alongsid his golden globe and i believ he must have done an outstand job consid kevin spacey wa excel i wa wrong i realiz that peopl say this not to anger the african american communiti if they are not african american themselv i alway hear complaint on how african american are never nomin and how they should have won sometim this is true not a much nowaday becaus whoppi goldberg should have won best actress for the color purpl and the movi should have won best pictur the onli reason this movi wa so blown up the way it wa is becaus peopl see a movi about the semi spoiler hardship of an african american dure a veri racist time period and they automat label it a a masterpiec denzel washington is an outstand actor but his role in this movi did not affect me whatsoev i wa bore with him in the movi and his act here wa quit similar to his role in malcolm x but not a good the audienc is suppos to leav believ this man rubin carter is a saint peopl left the movi worship this man this hero and they went out and bought his book make this hero of a man rich spoiler this movi tell the tale of a man who spent the major of his life in prison main for crime he did not commit of cours the crime he did commit steal most wa onli to surviv noth more peopl felt sorri for him even though the drug dealer and thiev probabl amount to a much for the same reason but are look down upon in societi everyth in this movi tri to portray this man a a saint except for the obvious infidel he had toward his wife and the aggress he show the other man when he met his wife but whi wouldn t it after all it is his point of view i do not like movi especi hollywood interpret that are base on true stori becaus they usual distort the true part into someth el someth not so true this wa his point of view and a hollywood construct yet everyon believ it wa the truth unquestion well i research his past a bit befor make ani assumpt and he wa a veri violent man not onli that there is still a possibl that he did murder those peopl if you do not believ me search for him on the internet and read the articl some peopl have of him the box match he claim to have won so easili wa actual won by his oppon joey giardello and there are tape to prove it besid that there are mani twist and purpos left out fact in this movi the support cast were the nicest peopl i have ever seen on the face of the earth and their nice and perfect persona look difficult to keep up this movi wa a hollywood version of yet anoth unfortun true stori that is still left to be told truth denzel s act is stale and the support cast s mickey mous attitud are annoy the movi also begin veri slow pace and is bore 
 
 
 
this movi is anoth one on my list of movi not to bother with saw it year ago a an adolesc stay up late to do so wa veri annoy to find that it wa about romanc everyth el histori if that it s what i call a bait and switch movi one with an interest titl the actual movi is a scam this is a subject which deserv a good cinemat treatment this movi is almost an insult to those who serv the actual member of the lafayett escadrill were not on the run from the law nor were they the product of abus home they were in realiti idealist who want to do someth to help franc and i suspect mani of them came from a more upper class background than tab hunter s charact fli school is not for the smart aleck and the know it all an individu such a the one portray here wouldn t have last two day it would have either been the stockad or the infantri disciplin in the french armi wa often rather fierc in short anoth hollywierd version of an histor episod that deserv proper treatment 
 
 
 
probabl the worst film i ve ever seen the act and stori were terribl and i almost fell asleep the onli good actor wa colm meaney i had the impress to see the same scene again and again until the end no emot no charisma noth 
 
 
 
i had high hope for this film becaus i thought clean shaven kerrigan s first featur wa absolut terrif the most assur cinemat low budget film i d ever seen but much of clair dolan is utter pointless and flat scene after scene seem random toss into the mix without much thought for narrat or charact is clair tri to escap be a prostitut or not hard to tell whi doe she pick up the trick at the airport if she want to escap that life whi doe she then not pick up trick when she need money in seattl whi do we have to see her dye her hair to what is virtual the exact same color whi doe clair accept some john and not other the filmmak doesn t seem to know it feel a if everyth is improvis though i understand this wasn t the case and the filmmak just held a camera on it a if they were make a verit documentari after the screen i saw kerrigan defend his lack of narrat choic by condemn film narrat a polit conserv it sound like learn rhetor i think it wa a cop out i am sadden that the maker of a film a excit a clean shaven would go on to make such a lame film a this one and then defend it with tire old polit clich 
 
 
 
this is exact the sort of saturday matine serial i love dure world war ii i wa under ten year of age and that s the audienc this serial is design for look at it now one must roar at it ineptitud and stupid the budget must have been next to noth given the shortcut and repeat the act well this is republ pictur they read the line and no doubt had one take to make them convinc one and half star 
 
 
 
i heard and read mani prais thing about midnight meat train which is base on a short stori written by no le than clive barker and suppos the best adapt of his work sinc the origin hellrais that he direct himself but so far i can onli express veri mix sentiment about my view experi the most appropri term to summar the whole film in just word is nauseat the violenc is sadist and extrem which undoubt attract fanat young horror enthusiast but it s also indescrib gratuit and exploit normal speak i m veri pro violenc but it ha to at least serv some kind of purpos the butcher liter depict in midnight meat train is exclus meant to shock and to repuls the viewer with weak nerv system and easili upset stomach and even that isn t fulli effect due to the use of digit comput effect there are more shortcom some even bigger than the pointless gore but perhap i should focus on the good element first the basic concept is definit promis and multipl sequenc like the chase in the freezer room for exampl are liter ooz with nail bite suspens and macabr atmospher unfortun the pace is veri uneven and the elabor of the potenti fantast plot is made unnecessarili convolut presum the process of a short stori into a long featur film scenario is respons for the pace irregular but i honest feel they could have done more with the denouement a well a with the charact play by vinni jone the plot introduc leon an aspir photograph in new york whose agent advis to search for the truli menac face of the citi through sinist pictur leon then becom ob with stalk an introvert and suspici behav butcher who alway await the midnight train leon s right a the butcher turn out to be a relentless serial killer who liter crush his victim with a big hammer but the killer s motiv and behavior suggest there s someth far more substanti go on the rail at night midnight meat train take place in natur unsettl locat like subway station at night and anim abattoir plus the film also benefic of good act perform and a truckload of downright disturb imag like cadav on meat hook and train carriag smear in blood but director ry hei kitamura versus godzilla final war doesn t take full advantag of it all the end leav a whole lot question unansw and even if clive barker meant to have like this i still think we deserv a slight more clarifi final midnight meat train is a somewhat intrigu and definit haunt film but not without default it s not intend for easili offend viewer but mayb peopl look for plot coher and clariti should leav it alon a well 
 
 
 
i don t know whi but i thought i ve seen this movi befor mayb it wa the name mayb it wa the way poster look i don t know anyway it wa quit promis in the begin and even throughout the whole featur there were some bright moment mayb it becaus i m not a huge fan of the horror and i don t watch them a lot but this one actual look fresh sometim but the rest of it is not so good laughabl at time the movi is slow pace sometim you will get so bore you d forget what wa the stori about charact are not great either all of them the butcher is ok seem creepi and crazi enough although i didn t get what were those weird look thing on his chest that whole scene just look fake and kind of out of the blue and whi he wa collect those in jar at home the main lead is plain his charact is realli hard to believ in and veri undevelop but i guess that scenarist fault like whi he cri when he wa take pictur of his girlfriend side cast is bad too but the main thing i hate in this movi wa the girl my god when will woman in horror movi have ani brain it ridicul the girl find out that a maniac took her boyfriend camera tri go to polic that fail and then she think of the best idea ever whi don t we just go and take it i know where the maniac live yup that swell and then look for the camera in the bathroom whi not and then walk in the room see a bag that wa not there befor and just have a look insid mayb camera is there not there but load of interest stuff shini mmmm to realiz that bag mean that the butcher came back is too hard for her tini tini brain then of cours the never end fall while run away trick that realli made it look bad then to put the final nail into the charact in the end of the movi she walk into the wagon full with dead bodi hang foot up scream noooo like she just rip her gucci bag and walk further into the wagon jeez come on no one el think it just well stupid just aw if her charact wasn t so bad mayb the movi would get anoth star or two from me and i would even forgiv mmt charact that can take a hit in the head with a steel hammer that dude in the train who the conductor kill butcher vest that can protect from bullet weird and cheap look monster in the end i didn t read clive barker novel so i have no idea where those monster came from the fact that no one care that hundr judg on the skeleton in the dungeon disappear in the citi and main charact that didn t bleed to death when he got his tongu rip out he bare notic it i guess oh and the predict end damn i knew the end half way in it just disappoint the onli reason i m still give some credit to the maker is that the movi in general look better than most of the horror i ve watch past few month visual style is nice some shot were realli nice and good cgi that made the kill look realli brutal although blood didn t look real at all i guess some peopl will enjoy it some like me will watch it if there is noth el to watch some will absolut hate it 
 
 
 
i have heard a lot about this film with peopl write me tell me i should see it a i am a fan of extrem bloodi gori movi i got my hand on it almost right away but one thing or anoth alway kept me from watch it until now i would have been better off not rememb i even had it this movi wa atroci the worst thing though is that it could have been so much better than it actual wa i know it wa a stori by clive barker and all and no i have not read that stori but it appear to me that if you haven t then you will be a i wa complet clueless and utter disappoint the film begin good enough the actor are convinc the stori interest the first scene is bloodi a great way to catch your attent i thought the blood look a bit bad but see a it wa the veri first scene i did hope for improv later on i wa wrong the blood and effect are so horribl it wa almost an insult to my intellig to be expect to believ that for instanc someon could knock a person s head right off their shoulder use onli a meat hammer wtf cgi blood did they even use ani real blood at all my home made stuff look better than ani use in this film unbeliev act of dismember eyebal pop out just from get hit in the back of the head arm cut neat off doe no one rememb there are bone all throughout our bodi too dark scene everi scene is either an odd yellow color or in hidden in shadow it just get wors and wors i found myself point out mistak after mistak there s just too much add that to the fact that what could have and should have been a great serial killer movi turn into some demon supernatur monster movi at the end no thank you it should have been kept a a creepi guy butcher peopl in the subway ok with a conspiraci theori thrown in and an overzeal photograph mayb they murder peopl and sell the meat via the meat plant plausibl doabl and a lot better i think than the real stori that could have and should have work instead it becam a creatur live at the end of the old tunnel and everyon know about it but you and unless you read the book well you just won t ever understand it fiasco tragic what an aw thing to do to a movi with such potenti if you like mindless fake blood and gore you ll love this but if you have half a brain in your head then you will complet hate it stay away far far away 
 
 
 
one hour eight minut and twelv second into this flick and i decid it wa pretti lame that wa right after hopalong chris lybbert drop on his hors from a tree to rejoin the good guy po i wa pretti mystifi by the whole hopalong cassidi great bar gimmick which didn t translat into anyth at all obvious the name coppola in the credit couldn t do anyth to guarante success here even with more than one list if you make it to the end of the film you ll probabl wind up ask yourself the same question i did what exact wa the hook with the glove what s up with the rodeo scenario who wa the stranger suppos to repres whi did they make this film i could probabl go on but my energi s been drain look there s alreadi a western call the gunfight from with a guy name gregori peck a the titl charact watch it will make you feel a good a watch this one make you feel bad that one i can recommend 
 
 
 
i would just like it to be known that i do not often rate movi below a i wa origin veri excit to see this movi it numer trailer bump on tv for sever month made me reaalli want to see this movi so the other night when i saw that it wa avail on fearnet on demand i got some popcorn and sat down to watch the film the storylin seem intrigu enough some dude is butcher unsuspect peopl on the subway there s a photograph ob with the miss peopl where are they go what s happen to them one day the photograph see a connect between some photo he ha taken and becom ob with the butcher follow him around yada yada the film had a way of suck you in even though the plot wa high predict oh no it s dark look out behind you i say quit bore with the cheap thrill the plot even though predict wa intrigu that is until the end this wa good until the end then it just got silli say jack_skellington_frek on the messag board and i fulli agre and here come the spoiler see i wa hope it wa some mad killer some psychot person ob with cannib no it wa some secret societi keep creatur aliv for centuri woo how origin how unrealist how dull come on lionsgat you ve had amaz film but this one sunk 
 
 
 
do not bother to wast your money on this movi do not even go into your car and think that you might see this movi if ani other do not appeal to you if you must see a movi this weekend go see batman again the script wa horribl perfect written from the random horror movi format given a place in confin space a madman with various weapon a curious man who manag to uncov all of the clue that honest polic offic cannot put togeth and an innoc and over curious yet beauti and strong woman with whom mani in the audienc would love to be abl to call their girlfriend mix togeth add much poor execut gore and what the hell let s put some freak in there for a littl spin to the plot the act wa horribl and the charact unbeliev borat wa more believ than this spoiler and can someon plea tell me how a butcher s vest can make a bullet ricochet from the person after be shot without even make the person who wa shot flinch i m in the armi we need that kind of stuff for ourselv out of and i would place it in the decim of that round up to give it the lowest possibl score i can 
 
 
 
i often feel like scroog slam movi that other are rave about or i write the review to balanc unwarr rave i found this movi almost unwatch and unusu for me wa fast forward not onli through dull clich d dialog but even dull clich d music number whatev origin exist in this film unusu domest set for a music lot of fantasi some anim is more than offset by a script that ha not an ounc of wit or thought provok plot develop individu june haver and dan dailey appear to be nice peopl but can t carri a movi a a team neither is realli charismat or ha much sex appeal they re both bland i like billi gray but his charact is pretti one note the best part of the film to me are june haver s beauti costum and great bodi 
 
 
 
i wa never so bore in my life hour of pretenti self ob heroin addict basket case loung around whine about their problem it s like watch lizard molt even the sex scene will induc a serious case of narcolepsi if you have insomnia rent this 
 
 
 
one previous review call this film pure visual joy i am wonder if s he saw the same film that i did high art had to have the most relentless depress interior sinc seven one can almost forgiv sheedi and mitchel for the clich of go to a b b for their first time of cours befor they do that one ha to watch opium den parti inhabit by peopl who are not appar gain employ but can somehow support a flourish drug habit not to mention the ici stare from those familiar movi type the girlfriend boyfriend at start who are well awar they re go to be thrown over sometim in the next minut or so the movi also state that the sheedi charact ha retir from profession photographi for ten year now what did she do retir at age twenti 
 
 
 
this wa a popular movi probabl becaus of the humor in it the fast move stori an underdog charact who shut up all the loudmouth etc funni thing is you probabl couldn t make a movi with this titl if you substitut anybodi but white a anyth el would be deem racist by the pc polic nonetheless woodi harrleson a the white guy who turn out to be a good if not better than ani of the black basketbal player is interest a is his main counterpart wesley snipe snipe had a lot of funni put down line provid much of the humor the bad part of the film which doesn t bother a lot of peopl is the extrem profan in here and the sleazi of all the charact that includ woodi s girlfriend play by rosi perez there are no realli clean nice peopl in this movi for that reason i can t honest recommend the film at least not to friend or those who are offend by a lotof profanity
 
 
 
you know a movi is bad when the highlight of it is be abl to see a brief moment of jeopardi the saddest thing about white men can t jump is that it had tremend potenti for sever year i live in area quit like that portray in this film racial tension were high and basketbal meant everyth to everyon a film about the member of this basketbal cultur could have been veri interest but the mediocr act and poor script in white men can t job left someth to be desir the movi s sequenc of event is cyclic first billi either win or lose money by play a game of basketbal he then return to his home and loung around with his girlfriend and the process is repeat most stori build up to a climax of some kind but the climax i saw wa just anoth sequenc in this repetit this case be billi either win or lose money by play a game of basketbal in order for a plot to develop some dilemma must be resolv and this dilemma must be interest if the film is go to be interest a well appar the writer of white men can t jump forgot this rule a the plot can be summar a billi need to pay the bill i appreci the chang of pace from other formula sport movi but i m sorri this wa just plain aw i could have care le if billi got the money to pay the rent for his apart despit all this white men can t jump is a success film appar some adam sport fan will dismiss terribl write for a few scene with a basketbal in them other i m sure were lure by the big name play the lead role this leav me to wonder if the cast wa replac entir with previous unknown actor and the basketbal theme wa replac with lacross would anyon have bother watch this movi i realli don t think so i ll give this movi two star out of ten the extra star is for the jeopardi scene which kept me awak for a few minut thank trebek

first off i agre with quit a bit that escap mr chomski s mouth his matter of fact deliveri of interest counterpoint is what make the man a hit on the univers campus circus he come across likabl unassum pragmat he doesn t cater to the current polit style obnoxi bi partisanship and he set his sight on the far left a well a the far right chastis both and for good reason unfortun the film itself is a dud in fact i would not even call this a documentari but rather just a collect of speech watch rebel without a paus is no differ from watch a speaker on a am tape segment on cspan there are no camera movement no edit no stylist touch there is no stori no narrat technic speak the product is strict amateurish audio is terribl and inconsist sometim we cannot hear noam speak other time we cannot hear the question that are be posit by those in attend when noam is speak rare are we allow to see the reaction of the audienc except when we are given a quick shot of his wife who appar attend everi one of his speech and beam with pride everi time we see her i cannot recommend this film and would say that you re probabl better off check out his tape speech on cassett or cd to listen to in the car out of star and i m in a generous mood today

what more can i say the act wa almost without except amateurish the direct and continu were piti the sceenplay wa predict down to the veri last scene and the dialog tedious one of the featur on the dvd wa label gag reel but that could have been a descript of a viewer s reaction to most of the movi one of the most amus thing wa in the director s comment on the dvd he said with a straight face that he had set out to make a movi with high product valu and a name cast and that he had succeed with delus like that it s easi to understand how the movi turn out a it did perhap the most disappoint aspect wa the monster the darkwolf suit wa a modifi ape suit per the make of featur on the dvd and rather look it the mask and claw were littl better than off the shelf job from ani costum store the cgi effect were pain obvious and of qualiti similar to an inexpens video game 
 
 
 
let me start by say that i d read a number of review befor rent this film and kind of knew what to expect still i wa surpris by just how bad it wa i am a big werewolf fan and have grown accustom to forgiv a great deal when watch one most of them have sub par effect poor act and weak storylin at best rehash from earlier film so far with the possibl except of some of the later howl seri film this is the worst of the lot first the stori it s been quot sever time in review on this site so i won t go into specif howev it is veri obvious that the writer s had absolut no affin for lycanthrop monster a so often happen when a horror film is given to a writer who consid themselv abov such fare they tri to come up with a new spin on the werewolf mytho that s fine but a non horror fan tri to do this general ha disregard for the intellig and sophist of the horror audienc and end up write down to them the plot feel like a parodi of werewolf film and the event depict just ring so fals that i felt my intellig wa be serious insult tv news footag for exampl never pan away from the report to close up on someon in the crowd behind them give the charact and the viewer credit for be abl to spot the bad guy in the scene without use a flash neon sign and that s just the tip of the iceberg a for effect i have never seen a le believ werewolf i d have been happier with lon chaney jr in crepe hair the beast they use look a great deal like well like a guy in a cheap rubber suit with some hair glu on and some truli aw animatron and i know that mani peopl have alreadi critic the cg but my god it wa aw one scene featur a woman chang and start with a complet cg version of the actress nude but for some reason without nippl my first thought wa hey whi is one of the charact from reboot turn into a silli look werewolf anyway i like to look for posit in ani film and there were a few the cinematographi wa passabl the film wa shot all digit which is interest and some of the perform were not terribl it wa also interest see tippi hedron a the world s most well made up homeless woman and kane hodder a the titl bad guy also the yellow power ranger got all grow up and well damn and if you re look for skin there s some pretti tasti exampl this end the male pig segment of the review overal if you want a good werewolf film tri an american werewolf in london the origin the howl dog soldier or even the wolfen though that one s got more wolf than were if you re a lycanthrop completest then take a gander otherwis give this one a miss 
 
 
 
there isn t much to say about this film it is horribl the act and dialog are way far away from even decent the stori of the hybrid werewolf s is not veri well explain and the whole thing ha plot hole here and there cgi is someth you wouldn t like to see it so amateurish that it make me vomit the onli good thing on the dvd wa in the extra the gag reel everyth el just wast of time and money i hope noon will buy this this is not even worth rent just stay away of this

i thought i wa go to watch a scari movi and end up laugh all the way throughout the movi in the scene where the human transform to a werewolf i thought they wa kid today comput game have ten time better anim low budget is a fit comment i would recommend wolf with jack nicholson for a good werewolf movi it ha good special effect a they should be human transform to werewolf unless you wish to have good laugh i would not recommend you to watch this movi this movi is a joke

this is the absolut worst piec of crap i ve ever had to watch actual it wa so bad that i just had to watch it the cgi is sooo bad it s fun it s not even close to the shitti cgi anim in spawn that s how bad it is har har har i m amaz over the fact that some distribut compani actual ha put money down to releas this on dvd but i guess they ll get more money out of it that way co the cost of make it can not have been more than a few hundr dollar it s so aw that a kindergarten class could have made it see it and laugh 
 
 
 
where to start i feel violat that right violat i just spent hr of my life hr that i could have spent do someth more use like watch paint dri on this so call horror flick it not scari it not funni it not dramat it no action it noth it predict it bore it tragic i might come of a bit harsh here but watch this movi and you will feel the same way or no don t watch it unless you want to feel violat also 
 
 
 
this is the prime exampl of low budget win over what would be a good stori line let s bring back samair armstrong have seen her work on the o c i know she can do better then find a better script and budget the special effect were so bad and most bad comput generat that it almost lost me with the first time the wolf wa seen on screen and samair armstrong s alert chang into a werewolf wa done by reduc her at first to a bad gcif figur befor she even begin to chang final fantasi s human a well a pixar s made these laughabl think of the figur a a nude barbi doll the stori of wa interest though the idea of bloodlin in werewolv is noth new a it also got into the balanc between evil mayb not so evil and the possibl end of human kind should the two line mate the subplot of a book of werewolf linag which effect some of the other charact in a spell like manner for a while wa effect but could have been expand more in explain what had happen in the past bring in a better script and direct and i d come back again 
 
 
 
in this day and age of incred special movi effect this one wa a sore disappoint the actor seem stiff and uninspir a wa the dialogu western are not common fare for hollywood so much these day but movi like silverado prove that somebodi out there still know how to make a good one consid that it is hard to conceiv that anyon would go to ani expens at all in releas much le creat such a weak film a this one if you love and are look for a good western keep look 
 
 
 
i watch this film alon in the dark and it wa full moon outsid i didn t do it in purpos it just happen in this way so all the element were there for this film to scare the hell out of me well it didn t in fact i want to shut off the dvd player after onli minut but i thought come on give it a chanc unfortun i did the act wa aw the onli one with some decent act wa samair armstrong the plot is not origin if you are a horror fan then it is just the same stuff you have seen mani time befor some scene didn t make sen at all and you just get the feel that the director want to make the movi longer the monster wa the biggest disappoint of the movi the scari scene look like they belong to a horror movi from the s when there wa not enough technolog yet some good movi were made back then i wa surpris to see the name of a major product compani at the begin of the movi i thought couldn t they put some money in this and make it decent i couldn t agre more with the rate that the movi got it is also my rate for it out of 
 
 
 
anoth in a long line of flick made by peopl who think that know how to oper a camera is the same a tell a stori within minut the entir premis is laid out in just a few line so there is absolut no mysteri which elimin a whole facet of the suspens the onli half way compet actor is kill minut into the film so we re left with stupid charact run around do stupid thing low budget film can t afford expens special effect so the cgi portion are unsurpris unimpress but were at least a valid attempt the creatur suit is terribl a seen when it fall to the sidewalk and the director keep emphas the eye which aren t even the red color shown in mirror shot the dialogu is clumsi and uninspir with some line reminisc of alien or termin the last action sequenc take place in a polic station also a rip off from termin with everyon hide in the one glass line offic that the darkwolf doesn t smash into in the end the girl call the hero a good protector but he get both his partner the origin protector and at least three other civilian not to mention a dozen cop all kill without get a decent shot off in spite of an arsenal of silver bullet and a submachin gun but here s the real clincher for bad write they could have kill the beast right after the begin credit when it wa hold the stripper while flash it red eye instead they took it into custodi 
 
 
 
dark wolf quick review let s get right to it this is a repugn piec of rot roadkil with cow sh t on it it s just an aw movi it s an urban werewolf movi with some of the worst act imagin and a stori a weak a ani gang nerd from an s high school drama film what s wors is that poor kane hodder wa dupe into play the gigant evil werewolf kane f cking hodder someon s tri to ensur that play jason voorhe is the height of his film career anyway former playmat jaim bergman is also in the movi and she eventu becom a werewolf too it s kind of a crappi cop drama with the world s worst look werewolf in it but it doe have moment of near rampant nuditi but that s about all want to know more okay the werewolf is general an ugli look black blur zip around the screen and when we re privileg enough to actual see a transform sequenc we re present with someth that resembl a full motion video from a video game made dure the earli stage of the playstat the first playstat the cg anim is realli that primit onli good for horror hardcor fanat that want to see small moment of nuditi surround by rampant visual vomit www residenthazard com
 
 
 
i saw this movi at a sneak preview and i must honest confess that i do not like film with meryl streep that much this pictur wa the worst half the theatr did not return after the break halfway the film i couldnt blame them if this wasn t a true stori there had been absolut no need for the second half of the pictur just befor the film goe forward in time about ten year i myself wa expect the credit to appear 
 
 
 
we saw this on the shelf at the local video store saw coppola in the credit and got excit that wa the one and onli time this movi rais ani interest i could never quit work out if it wa an attempt at a humour film that fail miser or an attempt at a serious film that fail miser in general the entir product seem incred amatuerish the sound in particular wa absolut dread especi in the scene shot in the littl bar the dialogu wa so corni in part it wa unbeliev veri disappoint 
 
 
 
jack black is an annoy charact this is an annoy indi movi for year old do i have to write eight more line ana de la reguera is dang fine to look at a a mexican nun who put up with the rather forward and rude advanc of jack black this movi is a pg version of an indi film i realli like a movi that ha the courag to explor mexican cultur this movi explor mexican cultur deepli i just choke on it cultur rude jack black is just so rude a white person like jack black is not my most valuabl emissari into mexican cultur a it were mexican wrestl cultur is not the most diaphan venu a white guy such a myself could seek i suspect mexico is more cultur opaqu than jack black ha present here i think imdb chang my review ha anyon el had his review chang a well just a question 
 
 
 
i mean realli either i sudden lost my sen of humor or this is just a realli bad movi it s stupid ridicul and just not funni at all sinc i saw the preview i knew it wasn t go to be a great movi i just didn t think it wa gonna be that bad what happen to the good old time when you could find clever funni line at ani movi when the actor didn t have to play ridicul role in attempt to be funni now we find ourselv with movi like this one borat littl men scari movi where i could not find the funni part just skip this piec of garbag p s sorri for my english 
 
 
 
i m sure deep in the recess of jack black mind the charact of nacho libr is absolut hilari but no it isn t you can tell ol jack have a whale of a time hammin it up play a smarmi slimi mexican friar with dream of becom a wrestler but this movi is a total misfir in just about everi singl depart i just sat there through most of the movi think is this suppos to be funni and this is the guy from tenaci d right the truth is this film ha noth to offer at all it s a lousi script with crappi charact and realli naff act and direct you ll watch endless moment where you think someth funni is sure about to happen but it just doesn t i wa bore stupid about minut in but though it would sure pick up it didn t minut later i d bare manag to stave off an aneur it wa that pain it s like rememb year ago when you d see anyth with your fave actor in it even some of their realli earli pap from befor they were famous and you d be realli embarrass that said actor wa actual in such a load of plop yeah it s like that i ve enjoy some of jack black s earlier movi like shallow hall and i m realli look forward to see pick of destini but come on man if you do this to u again jack i m gonna have to come round there and hammer your kneecap or someth at the least give you a serious talk to i know it s a clich but this is one of the worst movi i ve ever seen and for so mani reason 
 
 
 
jack black can usual make me snicker simpli by breath but in this movi besid the direct write lack of plot constant mug aid and abet by constant straight on camera shot and a joke bat averag it wa still an utter wast of time the idea sound promis but what potenti there wa get wast with an utter lack of comedi and some of the worst direct i ve seen this side of you tube i kept hear that this film portray mexican veri negat while that s no doubt true i realli don t think this movi is meant to be racist i think that s it s more a result of a creativ team desper tri to find someth funni in this mess you can almost hear them cri out from behind the camera hey look it s an ugli mexican laugh peopl plea for the love of all thing tenaci laugh but put the racism charg asid when you get down to it it s anyon who plunk down good money and time to watch this pile of leftov refri bean that should be offend imo 
 
 
 
if it wasn t for the bad dialogu and script i mean the direct wa realli in touch with it s subject the actor were do good at bring their charact to life but in the end the thing that wa realli miss wa a solid script to hold all the piec togeth i would high suggest not to watch this unless you re a al pacino enthusiast like i am and will watch everyth he is play in even if the result late are rather poor this is after s m ne a second veri bad movi for this actor that onc knew how to choos role 
 
 
 
saw this movi in an earli preview and i cannot stress enough how bad i thought this film wa from the veri begin the audienc wa groan over pacino s aw southern accent poor al look realli realli haggard and i can t decid whether this wa purpos part of his role a a drug addict publicist or perhap he just didn t get ani sleep befor come to the set much wors than pacino s close up howev is the wretch excus for a plot earli in the film we are given indic that pacino s charact is gay and i suspect that is what the screenwrit had origin intend later howev we are suppos to suspend our incredul and believ that both tea leoni and kim basing both of whom are sleepwalk through lame role lust after this elder half dead look effemin man with the ridicul accent the worst part overal wa the main plot thread which had to do with some corpor espionag that is never fulli explain and we never ever care about in the slightest becaus this wa a preview i will reserv my final judgment becaus of the possibl of re shoot and edit but you can bet i will not pay a cent to see this in theater 
 
 
 
first i must admit that it isn t a good movi and i would never watch this movi if pacino wasn t in it the movi is about a publicist s strang hour and he is overwork dizzi sick and sometim regret i don t like the charact at all it s realli bore after minut you may fall asleep and i don t understand whi pacino want to be a part of this horribl movi just becaus of money or what sinc i m an avid pacino fan i bought this movi peopl i know if you haven t bought it yet don t even think about it it s just a wast of time 
 
 
 
i don t know what this movi is about realli it s like a student s art school project they never say whi the world is dark but it is alway dark except for second a day there are long interrupt shot of insect of all sort for no reason what littl dialogu there is in the movi is a inan and nonsens a the imag a black woman enter the main charact s apart somehow she becom pregnant overnight then get shot in the head the main charact take care of the bodi until it becom a cocoon after which a white nake woman emerg i have never been so blown away by how bad and pointless a movi can be honest i would like someon to watch it so they can tell me what they think it s about but i wouldn t wish this level of hell on anybodi el 
 
 
 
 peopl i know is a clunker with no one to root for and no one to care about despit the game effort of a talent cast pacino deliv his usual tour de forc a eli wurman a past his prime public agent hollow out by a lifetim of moral corrupt but unlik michael corleon it s imposs to have an emot invest in this charact his dilemma or his fate the film trace eli s prepar for a benefit for a liber polit caus while distract by a client s ryan o neal good in an underwritten part latest dirti laundri in this case a tv actress companion who s gotten involv with the wrong peopl tea leoni bring her customari star power to this support role although again the script doesn t give her much to work with a eli s sister in law kim basing manag to evok sympathi despit implaus plot mechan this movi is strict for those who like watch pacino strut his stuff and enjoy the other princip unfortun between the script and direct peopl i know is strict amateurish henc it limit theatric releas and speedi journey to dvd consid yourself warn 
 
 
 
yes mtv there realli is a way to market daria what start a a clever teenag angst comment on everyth that suck and make the viewer feel better about their sucki teenag life sitcom now mutat into a how you should deal with your problem charad i use to watch daria all the time and love it now sit here after watch the so call movi i can onli wonder what the point of this all wa daria tell u how to lead out life in colleg excus me didn t the point daria made everi episod that what you like to do is ok a long a it is ok with yourself no matter what the rest of the sick sad world think of it this entir thing remind me of the scene in realiti bite the movi channel show the documentri for the first time 
 
 
 
i want to watch this movi but one bizarr ridicul scene after anoth forc me to shut it off charact s don t seem to react to anyth consid this heath ledger is walk a night through a cemeteri i believ when he is attack by spirit which he drive away onc past this ordeal he calm walk away and meet up with a friend that saw it all when ask what happen he say bland attack by demon noth serious a if this is onli a littl more excit than a flat tire i shut it off when they go to ask someth a demon or someth i stop care a que ion the answer can onli be rent out of someon with the energi of their death and the priest watch in what appear to be vagu annoy a a man is strung up and hung and they ask his thrash die bodi question out of star 
 
 
 
the order fatal flaw besid an asinin plot is that the charact s simpli don t reson or even react two exampl a priest walk through a graveyard late at night is sudden attack by ghost spirit after fight them off he calm resum his walk when his buddi come up anyth wrong his buddi ask have seen the attack just some demon spirit noth i couldn t handl no reaction no surpris just like he d chang a tire his buddi is equal unconcern must be standard priest train [ and then you put the wafer into their mouth ani question ok move on demon spirit attack ] exampl two at one point the priest need an answer to a question and onli a demon or someth who care by now could provid it how whi you have to ask a die man so the demon ha some random person hung in front of the two priest so they can ask their question to the thrash gasp man hey don t kill him or mayb that s not nice would have been more realist then their respons they never ask that they let the man go or stop in fact the closest to react they get is mild annoy they ask their question and go i had to shut it off at that point my brain wa start to atrophi avoid one star out of four 
 
 
 
this realli is the worst film i have ever seen ever period i actual paid to watch this steam turd of a movi incred dull poor act dire script often incoher and too mani scene that don t seem to have ani relev to the overal film like when heath ledger s priest partner get s nail to a wall by a ghost what wa the point in that scene answer on a postcard plea i should have got a medal for stick with this film for it s entir run time i would rather take a strong kick to the groin than sit through this film again this should be cast into imdb s bottom hope my vote of will help it on it s way 
 
 
 
i wa realli horrifi by this eeri movi what an unusu dark atmospher and such a creepi music score realli promis inde after ten minut you realli start sweat and feel uncomfort for you start fear the worst this movi ha the atmospher of a true nightmar and what s wors it all come out for one hour and a half i have been tri to fight complet boredom and fall asleep but the monstrous soundtrack kept me awak nuit noir is a truli horrifi pictur for your eye your ear your intellig and most of all your wallet sinc the thought of spend precious money on a movi ticket for this cheap amateurist homevideo is the biggest horror of all 
 
 
 
first of all i have to say i have work for blockbust and have seen quit a few movi to the point it tough for me to find someth i haven t seen take this into account i want everyon to know that this movi wa by far the worst film ever made it made me pine for gig my bos s daughter and ani other piec of junk you ve ever seen belyt must be out of his mind i ve onli found one person who like it and even they couldn t tell me what the movi wa about if you are abl to deciph this movi and are abl to tell me what it wa about you have to either be the writer or a fortun teller becaus there s ani other way a person could figur this crap out for the love of g d stay away 
 
 
 
the come attract to the order make it seem like a decent horror mysteri thriller but what we get is a plot that ha potenti to be excel all thrown togeth to form a pile of garbag first off the whole movi consist of terribl dialogu and god aw special affect the act wa also noth to be proud of but keath ledger i think i spell that right save the movi in this categori for heaven s sake don t see this movi 
 
 
 
this sorri excus for a film remind me a great deal of what i heard about gig that ben and jen flop earlier this summer the order wa clear edit to such an unconscion degre that the scene rather than form a cohes and provok film appear to be a collect of disconnect sequenc that did littl to forward ani semblanc of a unifi plot now i m a heath ledger fan thing i hate about you a knight s tale and particular his support role in monster s ball but my man need to find himself a better agent keep accept script like the order and four feather and he s go to be on the fast track to movi oblivion here are the problem i had with the film first the director tri to make up for the inadequaci of his essenti plot by introduc two other plot line that seem had littl if anyth to do with well much of anyth plot skein involv the american tri to take over the vatican and the dark pope while mild interest did noth to reveal to the viewer anyth about the main charact the attempt to tie these thread togeth were pathet at best second plea don t insult the intellig of the viewer by insert into the film scene that are clear obligatori we had manufactur angst manufactur love and most idiot manufactur sex that seem like a page right out of matrix reload with skull numb techno music rather than develop charact these element seem like the cheap devic they clear were a half heart attempt at put popcorn chew adolesc in the seat third and most import this movi seem to ha ve an intrigu concept we have scandal we have religion and we have supernatur forc at play whi then do we learn almost noth about anyon s background we learn a littl about alex but even he give up the passion of the priesthood to sleep with a woman after two day a woman who tri to kill him dure an exorc at some point in the past and alex is the most develop if you can call it that charact in the entir film a the clich goe nowaday if you re go to see one movi this year make sure it s not this one there s about ten interest minut out of the intoler minut affair the onli thing that save me wa go with a girl who i m rather fond of out of i m disappoint file this one firm under had potenti but blew it on over edit and bad direct heath my man go back to monster s ball like cameo they realli suit you

the turgid pace of this movi numb u to ani shock that it might provid there wa no real suspens most of the charact were insipid the chesti irish priest wa a lame a the love interest interest is mislead the girl that they chose to provid the film s sensual might be better the central conflict of the main charact wa uninvolv this film is entir devoid of posit it is like a tedious exercis by someon who didn t want to go to the gym that day but did anyway

a an avid fan of the flashman book by georg mcdonald fraser i look forward immens to see flashi on the big screen when this film wa first releas sad it wa a huge disappoint then so i left it alon for year befor go back to watch it again but it wa no better the second time mr fraser is a tremend skill writer but i am not a fan of his film screenplay work with richard lester the penchant for slapstick spoilt the three musket for me and the same appli here to me the whole tone and feel of the film is wrong the flashman book are uproari funni in part but they are adventur novel there is much serious in the way the adventur that flashman ha after all he is involv in danger situat this is convey in the novel but not convey at all on film due to the it comed style it is a tremend shame a it could have a great film had it been a more faith adapt of the style of the book when i first read that the book wa to be film the articl said that the film wa to star oliv reed i rejoic a reed to me wa the epitom of flashman how i would have love to see him in the role malcolm mcdowel is a good actor but doe not fit the visual imag of flashman creat by the book too scrawni look flashman is suppos to be a big strap fellow neverheless reed wa excel a bismarck what kill the film is that it is made a a comedi the onli scene in which it creat the true atmospher of the book is the scene in which flashman kill de gautet tom bell a great shame a the product valu costum set etc are superb and the cast is general excel just about everybodi in the film is well cast apart from malcolm mcdowel possibl the directorship of richard lester wa respons for the way the film is a a recent radio adapt of flash for freedom adapt by mr fraser work quit well perhap one day we may see flashman done justic on screen 
 
 
 
raymond burr star a an attorney caught up in the murder of his best friend dick foran thank to his affect for his friend s wife angela lansburi this wa a full year befor he start do perri mason so the movi might be of particular interest to his fan if it wa the inspir for his cast there isn t all that much el here that s interest though lansburi is alway good but her charact here is veri one dimension and the motiv for her crime in the mysteri are total obvious there s an interest perform by lamont johnson a a painter who s also in love with the femm fatal but the burr charact is pretti straightforward it s frank bizarr to see an actor like burr do these romant scene with lansburi and his halt deliveri doe not match his charact here veri well a it doe in most film i ve seen him in there s no mysteri at all realli and the whole suspens is suppos to be around the titl of the film and the way that burr s charact is set up the lansburi charact to implic herself doubl jeopardi prevent her be tri again for the origin murder presum he doe so with a veri larg tape record which she doesn t notic when she come into the room i guess a few perhap unintent fun moment and basic the rest of the thing could have been done for tv 
 
 
 
the premis of this movi wa decent enough but with sub par act it wa just bland and dull spoiler the film doe not work becaus of the natur of the death it wa accident so although it wa a murder it wasn t like the guy set out to do it also through some flashback there is a secret that is reveal that sort of make the event like justic to a degre there is no emot in this film the first minut or so is just this woman call her sister and hear her messag it wa dull and bore with some polish and better act it could have been pretti good 
 
 
 
ok i watch a lot of bad movi i pride myself on that fact mani time there are some gem in the b rate bomb but this movi is one of the worst i have watch i like a good horror movi but one with a plot of and sen of movement the open scene seem pretti good decent music and imageri then it goe down hill from there one of the main charact ha a disabl ring in the ear call tinnitus now this will in turn threaten to reveal his secret they made that too much of a focus of the movi so what he ha ring in his ear and accident left an ear plug somewher where that he shouldn t have been no need to keep bring it up so this guy is have an affair with this girl and in a motel she fall and hit her head on the end tabl so instead of let everyon know of his affair he decid to dump the bodi now her twin sister is tri to find out where she is and what happen to her well after see her sister over and over again a a zombi like ghost and even point direct to the locat of the bodi she final find her now the bodi is recov and she is set out to deal with the one and onli suspect that kill her bad thing is that she didn t have much of a plan onli to pretend to be her twin and met the guy where the bodi wa dump the idiot didn t even believ he kill her so all is reveal there and even though she had a gun somehow she manag to get herself strangl so the last scene of the movi are of the spirit of her and her twin walk out of the water so you mean to tell me in this movi the bad guy win and not one but two innoc peopl die good thing about the movi imageri bad thing about the movi music sound effect long and drawn out misdirect of plot low grade act from some not all actors
 
 
 
i also saw this movi at a local screen about a year ago first i m go to say that it look great cassella is incred talent and a fantast cinematograph i just wish the movi had been a good a it look i would not call this a horror movi put in a few shot of a decay ghost doe not make it a horror movi there s no mysteri there s no suspens you know who did it the entir time it s a drama you know what s go on with both side the entir movi the act wa okay i guess but noth special and the taglin reveng can be dead realli they should have check how mani hundr of horror thriller movi have that exact same taglin it pain me to say some of this but i know a lot of the peopl who work on this movi and i know they don t want peopl blow smoke up their as so i give my honest opinion 
 
 
 
okay at first this movi seem pretti good even though it wa move rather quick and even though they onli had a budget it wa good but if you found your sister dead in a lake and found out who might have kill her whi would you go chase him around and pull a gun on him with onli one bullet and wast it and end up run from him all retard and get yourself kill plus after you found your sister dead in the lake and found a clue and figur out who the killer wa whi wouldn t you hand that clue over to the polic who think you kill her and at the end of the movi when she act like her sister who wa a waitress and she is talk to the bad guy she should of met him somewher and record him say she wa dead and what happen for her proof i don t know i wa not happi with the end this movi could of been so much better if it last longer and the act wa better and if the end did not suck so bad do not wast your money on this movi becaus if you do you will be write a review on here too and will not be happi 
 
 
 
just okay film about a woman who is a twin have disturb vision of her sister in danger back at home she then return home to find all is not well and that she is go to have to find out what happen to her sister and whi this is the sort of thing that kind of almost work but doesn t quit i can t realli put my finger on whi it didn t work but it wa good enough that i kind of wish it wa better or at least had gotten the littl thing right like have the girl who play the twin in the flashback be closer in size i think perhap that what wrong with it there are lot of littl thing that just are wrong 
 
 
 
this movi isn t worth the film it wa photograph on the dialog is flat fill with clich overus line and deliv by amateur actor who sound like their read a script for the first time the choppi shaki film style is a cheap imit of the the ring style visual effect the charact do not even act like a normal person would for exampl the charact who is look for her twin sister at her home forc her way through the front door creep around the hous all frighten and sob and she doesn t even onc call out her sister s name to see if she is home what you would think she had just buri her sister instead of search for her way too mani flashback to her childhood too mani unnecessari flashback is a typic sign of an amateur director it is actual funni watch the numer shot of the woman drive her car down the street up the driveway around this corner over here over there oh a side view now a front view enough alreadi you would think you are watch a tv commerci for the solari terribl movi out of i realli piti anybodi who spent money make this film or to watch it 
 
 
 
for a film with so much promis it wa disappoint thin plot and the act rang between horrend and unbeliev the plot had more hole in it than swiss chees and it s the worst clich d end i ve seen in a movi for some time the final scene would have rip my heart out if the entir movi hadn t been so pain to begin with i wa numb from the veri first scene one wa left wonder if the sister wa tri to reach out to her twin for help or simpli scare her to death which would have been better for the audienc and save u from two hour of the worst act i ve seen to date it wa a horror in the true sen of the word 
 
 
 
lolita is a rebel and she s go to share to our wide open eye some littl sex stori between sci fi and fantasi well this surrend cinema product is not veri good veri bad act horrifi music and a stori line without ani stori and ani line but the sex scene are pretti well done lot of lesbian scene and jacquelin lovel a beauti a in the exot hous of wax offer to u a veri good final and veri hot strip show for lovel s fan onli 
 
 
 
cybil richard direct anoth full moon surrend cinema masterpiec of erotica this time jacqualin lovel dress in rather fetch silver outfit is task with destroy all evid of sexual activ howev she can t resist watch the tape and she kinda like them the sex scene are well film and set to a superb soundtrack at least for this sort of film the cast are larg aw and main veri averag look too jacquelin lovel is her except attract self and between view the sex file she manag to expo her chest and fumbl a littl down below she also fit in a littl lesbian activ to be honest lovel deserv so much better than this kind of fare here she look great nake but actual is much more appeal in her silver attir narrat the drama utter rubbish movi with lovel and soundtrack the onli real redeem featur mediocr even for surrend s output and clear a new budget low for them also 
 
 
 
this movi wa bad beyond belief i saw it dure the san francisco film festiv befor it start the owner of the theatr got up and told u how half the audienc had left the theatr the night befor which happen to be it world premier i don t think anyon in the theatr understood just how bad the movi wa go to be at that point we all understood by the end it not a documentari though it wa sort of sold a one dark angel wa a bad biographi and misguid homag to betti paig in which half the movi is actual just remak of old betti paig movi the movi is onli minut long and the content of those minut is sub par to say the least a scene would start go then someon would say wow you re so great betti whi don t we make anoth movi this would be follow by a minut of a betti paig remak which wa almost a ridicul a and even more bore than the normal part of the movi by the end of the movi peopl were laugh everi time anoth betti paig movi remak came up it wa that ludicr i heard a lot of laughter in that theatr but peopl were not laugh with the movi maker they were laugh at the movi and it poor content and structur this wa easi to tell a the part that would get the most laugh were the one which were suppos to be serious or revelatori i know movi are expens i have seen mani cheapli made independ film but somehow the cinematographi and qualiti of this movi set it apart from anyth el i have ever seen the movi look like it wa made for the cut the graini and the lack of a sensual plot made this a memor experi this movi make dude where s my car look like citizen kane my friend and i left the theatr feel like we had just paid dollar to be tortur the onli redeem part of the experi wa that we got to laugh about the fact that someon had actual made this movi and thought it wa good appar the previous night the night of the world premier the director writer produc had been in the audienc and had gotten to wit peopl laugh at and walk out on his movi betti paig s movi were destroy they should destroy this movi too 
 
 
 
the major flaw with the film is it uninspir script it plod back and forth between vignett of betti s stori and re creation of the klaw short film while the klaw re creation are well done it is unnecessari to recreat them in their near entireti page richard while not an amaz actress doe a decent job overal and at time she doe bear a remark resembl to betti also of note is some faith attent to detail costum and cloth well done a is some of the set direct the set are general spar and feel stage y but do feel of the era it is sometim surpris well lit and the color palett wa clear thought out to give the overal look a vibrant retro feel 
 
 
 
they made me watch this in school and it wa terribl the movi is outdat the episod becom confus becaus fact is combin with fiction to make the stori more interest the teacher talk about it a a treat but realli it wa a pain bore experi i have read that veri few peopl who appear in this are actor but most of them them do what they do in the movi in real life this account for cheesi act veri often also veri often the stori becom mild outrag and far fetch i don t like the way some of the line were written and wish they had more mean to them though it wa written to be educ funni suspens and hip it end up be bore dri far fetch and old i hope no one take time to watch this movi becaus you would be just fine not see it 
 
 
 
the act is some of the worst i ve ever seen the charact are total unconvinc this could be overlook to some extent if the plot wa interest which the plot to the prodigi wa not it s sort of a bad mix between fresh and anim hous except that both of those movi were good 
 
 
 
in sixth grade everi teacher i had decid it would be a great idea to make this movi the curriculum for an entir semest everi class had someth to do with this terribl show we watch it in english and wrote in journal a if we were one of the charact in math we talk about chart and other sea crap in scienc we talk about whale which wa actual somewhat interest so this wasn t a wast of time all day everyday wa tortur not onli that but they would subject u to this horror twice a day by make u watch it in studi hall a well i could see if this wa a new seri or someth but it wa like i m still tri to block this out 
 
 
 
a far a i can tell you in spite of earlier comment post by other commentor this film is current avail on dvd i found it onli a few week ago it is on the valu dvd label and i paid the grand total of cent plus tax for it i found it at a cent store among rack of plastic bowl and dispos chopstick now don t you peopl who shell out beau coup buck for the super duper swedish import limit edit version feel like you were had i thought so this film wa inde well worth cent cent i might start to argu with you but clear worth cent and rememb that say about get what you pay for for slasher film maven onli

a a former kalamazoo resid with a fond for the town i wa look forward to see this movi but what a disappoint although the act and the product valu aren t bad the script is aw the plot is unrealist and the theme is disturb the main messag of this film is that woman are noth without husband and child i can hard believ how regress it is in it s view of woman ha the writer been live under a rock although i enjoy see my belov citi on the big screen i wouldn t suggest this movi to anyon it s terribl it s an embarrass to the citi it s name after 
 
 
 
i went to see this film with low expect but hope to be charm by see my home town on film sad that s about all i got the stori cover familiar territori the high school reunion but the plot is convolut and supernatur element add littl to this well worn theme though the qualiti of the act wa good overal the content of the film wa appal the sexism of the film wa blatant woman are appar unfulfil unless they are marri procreat or both though this wa couch a a post feminist choic wors still wa the racism the shrill jewish mother the black man who still live at home and gratuit cruelti torment the class geek we should be asham if these charact are thought to repres the inhabit of the citi of kalamazoo and the writer should be abash at have brought such broad and cruel stereotyp to the screen 
 
 
 
by read the box at the video store this movi look rather amus disturb you know the type funni but suppos to frighten you this wa not funni or horrif the write wa lame the joke fail to make me laugh even at their extrem mundan they were so expect the actor didn t even do much with such a not so good script at least i hope that wasn t their best watch this movi at your own risk i give it negat star outta 
 
 
 
i didn t know it wa possibl to releas a movi this bad the label sound so promis but you would think that with a cast of at least one of them would be abl to act my wife left me and went to bed after the first minut she made a wise decis 
 
 
 
if you are look for eye candi you may enjoy sky captain sky captain is just a video game inject with live perform the visial are nice and interest to look at dure the entir movi now say that the visual are the onli thing good in sky captain after ten minut i knew i wa watch one of the wors movi of all time i wa hope this movi would get better but it never achiev ani degre of interest after thirti minut the urg to walk out kept grow and grow now i own over movi and have seen probabl five time that number yet this is onli the second movi i felt like walk out of my entir life act there is none the three main perform are piti jude law also in the other movi i want to walk out on is just aw in the titl role i would rather sit through ben affleck in gig than watch law again paltrow tri so hard to be campi that it backfir in her face the last articl i had read said that paltrow is think of stay home and be a mother rather than act after this perform i would applaud that decis stori soap opera are better written the stori behind sky captain start out bad and get continu wors a it progress direct none everyth wa put into the special effect that stori act and direct suffer great even the phantom menac had better act and that is not say a great deal i would have to give this movi a out of avoid pay theatr price and wait until video releas 
 
 
 
in short this movi is complet worthless the idea is to make movi from the point of view of what someon from the earli s might think of the futur an interest idea but the lack of compel stori or charact prevent u from ever suspend our disbelief so the idea just flop appar the whole movi wa done with actor in front of green screen and we are suppos to be impress but a a graphic person the over soften wa an obvious crutch for hide the difficult sharp edg problem with green screen the color is major wash out to no relev effect except reduc the visual qualiti and i don t understand whi anyon would consid anyth render in this movi to be in ani way ground break if anyth the ridicul retrograd graphic have lower the bar for realli bad graphic they don t measur up even to the ancient jurass park graphic the model for the robot were so simpl plain and veri uncompel there were a bunch of weirdo prehistor like anim on that island but they are not explain in ani way the stori is horribl beyond belief in fact i can t believ i didn t just walk out of this movi the relationship between polli and joe is unmotiv and throughout the movi is base on distrust and decept whi is the morri paley charact even there we are not in ani way convinc that joe is heroic i mean he fli a plane and save one person polli for person reason yeah there s a great hero for you dex ha veri littl screen time so whi are we suppos to care about joe want to save him who were the nepaleas that lock joe and polli in the mine vault and whi would they do it rememb that the entir totenkopf oper wa robot plot hole whi did bai ling s charact a major fall from her excel charact in the crow halt the robot who had captur joe they were look for the vial and had not found them whi in the hell would dex be captur but not kill he doesn t have or know about the vial and the bad guy didn t know that polli had the vial and wa connect to joe and therefor to dex polli indic that they don t know anyth about totenkopf yet she ha some secret sourc about him that contain what appear to be a fair complet fbi style file on him the blank spot on the map a describ by the nepales if they know all about this mysteri area then whi the hell is their map blank in that spot at one point polli and joe have to give up their cloth they are burn joe is given new cloth that were ident to his old cloth yet polli is forc to wear some veri odd look bulki dress then in the same line of continu sudden polli ha her origin cloth back sigh how far off am i suppos to switch my brain to watch this crap we are suppos to be exhilar by the over produc music even when noth interest or remot exhilar is happen on screen and the act we re suppos to be impress with a bunch of bad british accent which charact isn t annoy i think ling bai s dialogu wa probabl the best in the whole movi she doesn t have a singl line the dialogu wasn t camp and doesn t even rise to the level of chees it just bad and annoy these peopl aren t hero s or compel they are the kind of peopl you would tri to ignor or disassoci with if you ever had the misfortun of meet them in real life i can t believ that this movi get an abov averag rate here on imdb imho it should be compet with batman forev in the bottom of all time 
 
 
 
the explod zeppelin crash down upon sky captain jude law s base present an adequ metaphor to describ how truli terribl this movi is first off let me state right off the bat that i sincer doubt that paramount will ever recov ani money from this film a cult hit it might becom but onli becaus it is so remark for what it fail to achiev i can see the studio pitch now let s combin s german expression and a s globetrot adventur with a modern action flick and use comput anim to domin everi scene wow won t that be a success skycaptain bludgeon the viewer with it sheer excess there are too mani fake explos too mani unconvinc dogfight scene and too few real moment where the charact are anyth but pain two dimension after all whi shock and awe with one float airship when you can have three or five or one hundr moreov what could have been a groundbreak film seamless combin comput generat imageri and human actor in a styliz and intrigu set will instead becom a flop in no small part becaus it fail to meet the most import requir of ani flick use cgi quit simpli the graphic are amaz poor from the movement of the car to the physic of the aircraft in the dogfight everyth seem to be just a littl off i m not be nit picki here in ani way an infant could notic that a car doesn t glide along the road like a maglev train unless it a merced s and for those of you rais your voic in protest cri out this is a styliz film it s not suppos to be like realiti let me just say this lord of the ring ha set the standard for integr real life actor with cgi starship trooper ha set the standard for iron scienc fiction film the rocket did a solid job reintroduc the decad of the s back into the hollywood film portfolio and tim burton s batman creat a uniqu pictur of new york citi gotham that ha yet to be repeat sky captain fall so short of all these film it is hard for me to mention them in the same sentenc plus the act is so poor it make me posit ill so there you have it i spent to see this film and you get my review i hope it might dissuad you all from make the same mistak that i did 
 
 
 
a gave it a instead of a aw becaus there is no deni that mani of the visual were stun a lot of talent went into the special effect and artwork but that wasn t enough to save it the sepia tone wash out color sort of thing ha been done befor mani time in other movi noth new there i can see there were some hat tip to other old classic movi ok no problem with that but a movi ha got to be entertain and interest not someth that would put you to sleep the stori line and the script of this movi wa aw the charact two dimension slow move some of the scene were pretti to look at but ultim a a whole it wa quit bore i couldn t recommend it 
 
 
 
sky captain is possibl the best aw movi i ve seen in a long while rife with amaz cg and special effect stud with an a list cast jude law gwyneth paltrow angelina joli and the infinit likabl giovanni ribisi and race along with an overus but indiana jone esquir storylin this should have been a great movi to watch should have be the key term here of cours jude law play joe the sky captain with a dash accent and plenti of over the shoulder heart melt smirk but you can t make someth out of noth and even his flippant deliveri and boyish good look can t save the movi s stone dialogu if he had slap giovanni ribisi on the back and said good boy dex just one more time i might have barf all over the guy in front of me gwyneth paltrow a polli perkin is noth le than nerv grate her nasal whine and not quit sarcast comment get old in the first ten minut of the movi perhap she put too much effort into play the stereotyp s comic book heroin who know i expect more from her an exampl of how a similar charact wa play and play well is in the late s flick the phantom star kristi swanson and billi zane rent the movi and you ll know what i mean giovanni ribisi and angelina joli were the save grace in the film angelina joli wa incred hot in that eyepatch i ll admit it in just a few short scene both actor somehow manag to rise abov the tire materi and deliv a more rivet perform than their dri two dimension castmat the plot and steadi stori progress were old bore and basic just a monoton combin of everi good scene from an action movi in the past thirti year the pace is rapid fire in the first half of the movi and a snail s pace in the second give the audienc enough time not onli to guess the eventu conclus of the film but to figur out who the key villain is a well the pair is rather clich d also polli perkin and sky captain appar reunit after sever year of separ from a bitter end romanc and their stori isn t so much charm and eclect a it is annoy and mismatch when they final come to term with their mutual feel toward the end of the film nobodi s surpris and nobodi realli care either prop to the director for appreci bai ling enough to dress her in skintight vinyl for the entireti of the film and also for the intrigu sepia tone that serv a color throughout but sky captain despit have all the essenti element of be a great movi fall flat on it face not even worth the i paid to get into the theater 
 
 
 
visual interest but fall flat in the origin depart this tedious excercis in techniqu wear thin after the open battl jude law ha the charisma of burnt toast but in his defens this film contain some of the worst dialogu i have ever seen on the big screen in fact the script is so poor that it keep take you out of the film and had me think about work bill my dog etc there are mani moment that scream bluescreen paltrow is a wooden a they get this could of been save by snappi film noir dialogu or over the top camp my onli complaint on the techniqu is that black white film sorri comput would of help becaus it look like turner color black and white just a big dull clich mess i would rather break my femur than sit through this endur test again 
 
 
 
in a word this film wa bore it lack life and spark a big problem is with the two lead jude law and gwyneth paltrow had no chemistri whatsoev he wa bore and she wa annoy the visual were interest but they didn t enhanc the scene if anyth the visual tend to detach the audienc from what wa happen on screen none of the action sequenc felt real and henc the film fail to creat ani real drama or a sen of danger the film had potenti but it need a better script better act and a better director i kept think dure the film you know this movi would ve work if harrison ford wa sky captain karen allen wa polli and steven spielberg wa the director ignor the critic acclaim for this film the critic i think are prais the film becaus they want to like it and want it to succeed even though it fail on so mani differ level 
 
 
 
this movi feel so empti in everi scene in the movi the maximum number of actor on the screen is like becaus everyth wa shot in front of a blue screen there are never realli ani extra and the movi just feel weird the act wa horribl it s so obvious this wa in front of a blue screen becaus all of the action scene you can see the actor actress wonder around half run when they should be run for their live look at the floor for their mark spoiler also you ll find yourself bang your head watch the movi at one point at sky captain s home base they have like plane sit on the airstrip they have advanc warn an attack is come so what do they do noth all of the plane get blown up and yet again the onli person fight back is the sky captain the entir world is under attack and he s the onli person ever fight back at the veri end of the movi you see hundr of plain take off final but what do they do noth the movi is over 
 
 
 
i went to school with jeremi earl that is how i heard of this movi i don t realli know if it wa in the theater s at all i don t recal the name i have seen it it is like one of those after school special the act is ok not great the plot wa kind of weak and the line were pretti corni so the onli comment i can give this movi is eh i borrow the movi from jeremi if i wa in a movi rental place this is one that i would walk past and after watch it i wouldn t recommend it to anyon past middl school age i ve also notic that mani time when urban kid are portray the slang is overus or just outdat mani time i think that what make their charact unbeliev 
 
 
 
to start with i have to point out the fact that you re gonna feel complet lost for more than half an hour yeah some thing happen but you don t know whi or what for when you final figur thing out you just realiz that it s noth but a twist soad opera deal with matur prostitut dead mother illegitim son the charact are rather poor and the actor special the young one don t help that much to make em look credibl onli marisa pared stand out but she s a superb actress no matter if the movi is pure rubbish the onli posit thing to say about fr o sol de invierno is that d butant pablo malo seem to have good intent and he s film a coupl of scene that are quit intens well mayb the next time my rate 
 
 
 
okay so there aren t realli that mani great movi around recent gem like american dream the straight stori and even toy stori don t normal come so close togeth but boy doe this film counter balanc the qualiti i have no idea what these peopl thought they were do are the financi in this world so easili convinc to fund such a crock of i can just see it now produc so we ve got joe fienn he s cute a a button and wa pretti good in shakespear in love and we ve got rhys ifan who isn t cute but wa cool in not hill we ll mix in a realli mediocr score a few forgett post britpop tune hemlock root and lizard brain and hey presto you ve got the worst film of the new millennium and believ me it s gonna be a hard job to make anyth a bad a this in the next thousand year the bank i like it ani unnecessari sex bad camera movement and what about the worst accent this side of devil s own produc yeah we got plenti of those the bank sound great where do we sign plea 
 
 
 
i rent this think it might be interest and it might have been an interest stori except that is wa told in such an uninterest manner hard to follow strang edit disjoint storylin the charact mumbl all in all a dread dull wast of time i just couldn t get into it and didn t care what happen to the charact not even ian holm could save this film unless you need a cure for insomnia i d skip it and that s be generous 
 
 
 
i have seen bad film but this took the p made no sen and all the charact do is swear everi coupl of second oh and i think one ha a low sperm count it that good a welshman play a sweari cockney a posh english bloke play a foul mouth unlov rogu of a paddi and some lesser light play dim tart and there are some russian gangster oh yes some one ha a gun and mayb talk rubbish whilst high on drug avoid this film like the plagu 
 
 
 
we know from other movi that the actor are good but they cannot save the movi a wast of time the premis wa not too bad but one workabl idea interact between real bussinessmen and russian mafia is not follow by an intellig script
 
 
 
 the first film i had to walk out on and it wa the cast and crew pre screen not that i wa involv i hasten to add i made it through the first hour so i reckon i m just qualifi to comment but that wa my limit like other comment here how did this get through ani kind of qa an accumul of the veri worst in dialogu the epitom of wooden act aw cast all wrap togeth without a plot tara fitzgerald s cast wa bizarr almost comic she posse the worst russian accent in movi histori a i left the screen the director and produc were drink in a bar outsid the cinema they obvious couldn t sit through it again either 
 
 
 
i shall not wast my time write anyth much further about how everi aspect of this film is indescrib bad that ha been done in great detail alreadi mani time over the plot start out a a veri uninspir cockney wide boy gangster by number bore and veri quick descend into an utter shambl anybodi who pretend that they can see some hidden masterpiec insid this aw mess is just kid themselv it is now or year sinc i watch it dure it week run at the cinema befor it wa pull yet it stick in my mind for be easili the most terribl film i have ever seen i am onli make these comment and inde the onli reason i went to see the film is becaus of the amus fact that my brother eddi appear in it a the second heavi in the pub scene it wa his hand that thrust a zippo lighter toward rhys ifan s face in the bar in russia it wa actual film at the former butlin holiday camp at barri island my brother ha absolut no act experi whatsoev he had recent join an extra agenc and this wa his first part have seen the film it appear that nobodi in it requir ani act experi whatsoev i rememb there were about peopl in the whole cinema and this wa just a coupl of day after it had been releas i have never heard of an other film that wa so unpopular and disappear so fast and right so in case you were think of rent this film on dvd i would advis you instead to put your two pound coin in a fire until they are red hot then jam them into your eye socket this will probabl be a lot le pain than watch the film 
 
 
 
word realli can t describ how bad this film is i thought zandale wa bad but at least that had some nice shot and the occasion good chin stroke moment here and there to stop you from nod off this is just laughabl terribl script poor direct aw act and you know what i can t think of a singl thing to recommend about it other than the fact that it isn t too long if you want minut worth of entertain book yourself in at the dentist and have some root canal work far more enjoy and much better valu for money assum that you need it incident i need to type line of text to complet this review plea do not buy this movi it is terribl

there are two group of peopl those who love everi fellini movi they see and normal peopl while i will admit that i have realli enjoy some of his film i can also honest say that i can t stand some of them my opinion by the way is not just some knee jerk reaction i have seen most of fellini s film and have also seen mani film by the world s most famous director with this in mind i feel that the most overr and annoy director can be both godard and fellini they both have delight in the bizarr and often unwatch and yet have receiv gob of accolad from review and the intelligensia while the averag person would never sit through some of their film heck even a person who love intern cinema would general be left out in the cold when see some of these film so sinc onli a small cliqu actual watch their film and they are alreadi predispos to see the director a genius it s not surpris that their film are so often prais it s like a cult if you don t believ me think about mani of godard s film such a first name carmen or alphavill or what about fellini satyricon or juliet of the spirit these film abound with boredom weird and incomprehens now i am not say a film can t be weird after all i love happi of the katakuri and shaolin soccer but it must be watchabl now on to this movi somehow fellini ha manag to make a stori about a sexual compuls man complet bore and unsexi this is no small task it took a lot of work to make this so unwatch instead of cheap sexual thrill the sex act are choreograph in a silli and annoy way while the charact of casanova is buri under so much makeup and prosthet that donald sutherland look like a ghoul i know some of this must have been fellini s intent but mani viewer will be left complet bore by this steril perform especi sinc sutherland s line are all poor dub into italian and so he neither look nor sound like himself unfortun when the movi is not wrap up in these bore sexual escapad there realli isn t anyth el to watch an interest note about the first sexual conquest shown in this dull movi is that the actress look amaz like a younger version of fellini s wife giulietta masina consid that in addit to this that in previous decad fellini had masina play charact such a a prostitut and a horribl abus woman it seem like he may have truli hate his wife and wa have this act out on screen i read a bit about them and their tempestu relationship and it seem to bear this out a well this is about the onli aspect of this turgid film that i found at all interest don t say i didn t warn you 
 
 
 
this is certain one of the most bizarr film ever made even for fellini about the onli one more bizarr is his satyricon this is a two and a half hour romp through a strang nightmarish world of decad opul and sexual challeng sutherland make a curious unapp casanova and the odd go on in a seri of unrel vignett taken from the great lover s autobiographi fail to engag the viewer the art direct and costum design are howev outstand the academi miss on not even nomin the former but did itself justic by reward an oscar for the latter also nomin odd wa the disjoint pointless and almost inacess screenplay go figur the film on video is onli minut minut short of the origin run time this viewer wa grate 
 
 
 
i should explain whi i gave this piec of art star rate out of possibl simpli becaus it s hard or next to imposs to rate it unbias probabl it would have been the same if i had given it explan anyway would have follow i am not fond of these pointless gore movi like hostel or so i think that s disgust and pretti terribl in all the possibl contextu mean but a i found out after watch this movi there is a genr call histor drama and probabl it would have been the case of a it ha plenti of it and tarantino would have been more than happier with it and made kill bill to spill even more blood on screen than here to show that it is possibl but the thing about histor drama genr is that it s a sub categori of the trash movi where john romero is the undead gori emperor of the gut and so automat it can t be rate a your default movi a these are movi that are made bad on purpos and you can t realli tell whether the comic bad moment wa meant to be so or it wa simpli bad it s for the peopl who like to enjoy bad act bad screenplay and bad everyth el and by some turn of faith i am one of them too there are day when i have an urg of see a realli bad movi and look up for some trash and here you go the day is save but that s definit an opinion of mine and doesn t have match with anyon el what i want to say is that if you want to watch some terribl movi then fellini s casanova is definit the choic but heed my advic and don t rate it by default mean 
 
 
 
i wa veri unimpress with cinderella and jungl book but this is possibl wors than both titl first of all i didn t like the anim veri saturday morn cartoon onli wors in some scene i like some of the charact name thunderbolt and patch but the other charact like cruella were mediocr cruella wa truli villain in the origin but she lost her qualiti in the sequel what she said wa noth at all to write home about and her anim wa kind of ugli also her artist companion lar wa a joke to be honest with you and roger seem to have quit smoke overnight the voic talent were veri good though especi barri bostwick a thunderbolt with the except of jodi benson the accent ruin it for me there were some good moment but the whole plot seem bloat for me and high suggest of an extend tv episod all in all a huge disappoint sequel to the most memor of the s disney movi along with jungl book sorri i can onli give this a it just wasn t my cup of tea bethani cox

that s pretti ridicul i hope mani peopl are expo to muslim who live all over the u s u k and all over the world the religion ha over a billion follow i myself born and bread in america and through my religi class and teach i have been taught to cherish my countri and work to contribut to the societi i am veri dedic to the follow and teach of my religion have been stress through out life to educ and prepar oneself for success through educ in order to contribut back to the world i have know mani muslim from all over and i have travel to countri like pakistan i have yet to meet one person who believ that we should hurt anyon or not accept ani other religion except from the peopl in the medium i wonder whi also it sad that these extremist are the one the medium use to repres a whole religion it a religion of one billion peopl and these are le than one percent i am sure the other peopl of other religion would not like to be repres by the kkk ira and mani more which are simpl small percentag extremist who use outdat and not liter passag from the respect book in order to pursu their own reveng person or busi matter through their so call religion
 
 
 
the documentari and we use that term loo appar summar that muslim are tri to violent take over the world then state that ani muslim that doesn t admit this is either ignor of their own faith or lie to your face also everi person that is interview in the film ha found a market for their ludicr take on realiti by sell claptrap to conserv will to let other do the think for them what the west need to know is this is noth more than propaganda aim at mental midget if you are look for an actual documentari on islam and the current state of the middl east i would look elsewher tri someth that provid multipl point of view from qualifi sourc 
 
 
 
it is not obvious from view this film so i recommend viewer research the peopl who present their case in it but this present on the realiti of islam and it encourag of violenc and intoler against all non muslim is lack object and also complet fail to factor in the human condit it is one thing to document that the koran say mani thing about how a devout muslim is requir to interact with non muslim but ani realist is abl to realiz that not everi human who feel himself or herself to be a follow of islam will agre with and compli with all tenet of that faith and system there is reason to call much about the present into question such that viewer need to see the present with a healthi skeptic don t swallow it all hook line and sinker without some think of your own one specif for instanc is research the person walid shoebat who claim to be a former muslim who perpetr an act of terror in bethlehem there are mani wise peopl in the world who believ neither of these assert i am not nor have i ever been a muslim i have never read the koran i am not a christian nor a member of _any_ faith but i am an intellig and discern human while the film is quit disturb in it present of how some muslim view their oblig to islam i remind you that there is more to islam than the view of the fundamentalist just a their are fundamentalist and evangel christian so too there are variat in the intens of belief and oblig among jew and muslim when you watch this film you need to have the salt shaker on hand one grain will not be enough you ll need more plea use your own mind and think for yourself research what is present and evalu the state of the world and how islam fit within it base on more than what is said in minut of video there is a common thread of polit affili among those who put this film togeth indic a definit bias be your own brain

i tri twice to get through this film succeed the first time and it wa like pull teeth and fail the second time despit a great dvd transfer the problem it s simpli too bore if you can get to the dramat courtroom scene which take up most of the second half of the film you have it made but it s tough get to that point there are some interest talk by abraham lincoln henri fonda dure the trial the end is touch a lincoln walk off and they superimpos his memor statu over the screen it s a nice stori well act and such but it lack spark in the first half and discourag the viewer from hang in there i suspect the real abe lincoln wa a lot more interest than this film 
 
 
 
when i first watch robotboy i found it fresh and interest but then i notic that with each episod this show is tri to teach you how to behav yourself what is good bad episod becam predict and main charact are not interest again we see a hyper smart boy beaten by his older brother parent who don t understand their kid and his friend girl and fat boy also this show ha no logic a super modern robot who work on two aa size batteri and can use a lot of weapon but the biggest problem is the differ between activ and super activ mode we see two differ robot and it declin main idea of the show robot must learn how to behav himself in human societi

befor i start let me say that my experi of this movi might have been influenc by the dub which i gather from other comment wa the origin one which is consid inferior by some so it is entir possibl that subtitl or the appar new dvd version would make a differ i have also not read the correspond book i m onli familiar with one other japanes manga and might be lack cultur context potenti minor spoiler ahead i usual like dark ting scienc fiction stori the like of blade runner monkey etc but i did not enjoy this movi at all while it start out mild intrigu it becam tedious by the time it wa onli half way finish there are all sort of problem let s start with what is probabl the most sever the dialogu the charact seem unabl to formul complet sentenc if they aren t shout each other s name for the n th time they are usual grunt monosyl kanedaaa tetsuoooo huh grrr etc this leav most of the charact entir underdevelop and two dimension it doesn t help in the least that a lot of them get onli a few minut of screen time without anyth interest to say that would develop them away from the stereotyp suggest by the visual the grunt is augment by some random pseudo philosoph technobabbl that sound vagu and uninspir even by star trek standard there is noth deep and meaning here it all seem haphazard thrown togeth at random from various bit and piec of stock sci fi idea with no coher whatsoev what littl there is of an intellig plot is no more than an excus to begin the overlong final sequenc which consist of escal scene of mayhem and destruct not that there s anyth wrong with a nice bit of mayhem and destruct of cours but in this case you ll find yourself ask what s the point of it all and how long until it s over charact develop in the last minut or so consist of littl more than tetsuo turn into pizza the hutt for no readili appar reason the end resembl the one in a bizarr string of imag that far from resolv or explain anyth leav the viewer feel he s just been look into a kaleidoscop for two hour i m sure some will claim that this sort of thing is art but to me it wa just a lot of admit imagin use of colour and shape some of the music wa also quit interest unfortun it s all style and no substanc tire of disney want to watch anim movi deal intellig with adult theme i m sad to say you re more like to find that sort of thing in south park 
 
 
 
this stori is about the romant triangl between a nth african male prostitut a french transsexu prostitut stephani and a russian waiter who speak no french and never seem to shave a a film it is dull dreari and depress shot either on foggi overcast winter day or in bad lit interior where everyon is bath in a weird blue luminesc and yes i know it s becaus the white balanc wa out everyon is pale and downcast and look haggard shabbi and dirti bodi are boni and shot in such closeup that they look quit ugli and unapp mole greasi hair yuk bad news in a film where peopl spend a lot of time either nake or have sex and the stori well stephani s mother is die all three charact go back to stephani s home villag where through a bunch of flashback to desol countrysid and predict dingi interior we see a bit of stephani s childhood a a boy call pierr the mother die well and that s about it realli charact develop is kept to a minimum a is the denouement of the stori i suppos the storylin is not linear it would explain a lot of non sequiteur but realli after pay my seven euro i don t feel like have to construct the film myself that s what the director take my money for to expect me to join the stori tell process and get my hand dirti so to speak is ask way too much this film is a heap of pretenti rubbish made abov all from a desir to epat le bourgeoi ie shock the straight i can see how it wa a shoo in for the berlin film festiv and i can see whi it got nowher 
 
 
 
if you like film that rambl with littl plot exposit spice with kinki sex this film is for you on the plus side the lead actor actress newcom transsexu doe have an interest screen presenc but not enough to add up to much more than a mild interest movi if that essenti this film is about social outcast transexu prostitut male hustler and russian gay immigr who somehow have develop a bond whi is not clear we are expect to accept these misfit are at the core basic honest peopl who have the abil to love while they hustl their bodi on the street right and anna nicol smith wa truli in love with her nineti someth sugar daddi the filmmak show a gritti unpleas side of life while want u to believ underneath it all these serious damag peopl are realli quit normal to the extent they have a menag a troi which help them through life quit a fantasi but unfortun portray here a real look of life on the wild side in sum no plot no truth and no real reason to spend much time here unless of cours you just like to revel in the kink 
 
 
 
this wa a complet disappoint the act isn t bad but the product wa just so bad that at time i felt i need to stop it but i sad made it through and wa abl to finish it a bit embarrass by the whole poor movi it is o k if you are o k with cheesi moral plot and don t mind watch a movi that vast misconstru whitman if you want a cheesi fiction stori go for it 
 
 
 
this isn t a movi it is a collect of unrel ill conceiv and poor assembl scene that look like the unedit result of a dim year old with a mini dv camera in fact i have a theori that the extrem abras girl in the train corridor the one with the greasi hair dead pan stare ipod and nervous tic probabl shot it herself in a creativ phase if you made it further than the ten minut i did don t bother tri to fit what you saw into the context of the european artist mental prais abov this is a true and complet wast of time money and film that would have made william one shot beaudin cring the unfortun part is that the endless seri of vacuum pack charact is repres of what now pas for much of human what s next six director shoot social intercours at the wal mart snack counter 
 
 
 
when i first start watch this movi i wa look for some kind of subtl metaphor but it soon dawn on me that this movi wa inde about peopl on a train the interact between peopl are like those you can see ani day on the street and when in occas there is a slight more interest situat the dialogu becom stilt and bore it not that i don t get how this film is tri to portray the way peopl interact it s just that in this film they are veri bore if you want to see and analys these kind of relationship you d be best to actual go out and buy a train ticket and look at the peopl on the train with you it is realist but you wouldn t go to a movi to watch a film about you sit there watch the movi 
 
 
 
wow i can t believ peopl consid this a good movi now i have seen much wors but there are much more romant funni comedi with john cusack this is a mediocr film at best while the act wasn t terribl but not great for a romant comedi there wa littl passion littl romanc there were mani loo end that don t show up or are not address unfortun the main charact do come off a complet coward they don t know themselv well enough to realiz that they don t love the peopl they are engag to how do we know they aren t in love by the utter lack of remors both charact have for leav their financ i can think of few thing more romant than the continu escap from commit that these two show the movi doesn t even end with a wed scene more than like both will get cold foot and drop each other like hot potato onc a commit is near this movi is realli about two peopl who can t commit to anyth unlik cusack s previous charact who were more than will to make a deep commit loyd in say anyth martin in gross point blank etc the greatest failur of this movi wa the complet lack of ani twist turn or anyth of interest when the movi end i felt like they had fail to includ a climax to the stori which basic fit the whole movi bore no suspens about whether the two will end up togeth no joy when they do no consequ to their action it is sad that peopl are so blind to the shoddi of this movi that they simpli rebuk ani critic with everyon is too cynic critic of this movi is not cynic simpli unbias examin there are mani other better romant comedi even one with grace kelli or eva mari saint if you think this movi is great tri these movi you heart will explod the princess bride say anyth gross point blank high fidel keep the faith charad rear window north by northwest or there s someth about mari which is a good examin of ideal romanc v today s societi

plea note that i haven t seen the film sinc i discov it in and my town is smaller and doesn t carri it howev i realli want to say someth about it i m actual do research for univers on the titl charact richard mauric buck and would like to point out that the person they base the main charact on wa in realiti complet differ hollywood s idea of peopl and artist licens grant the real dr buck total endors hysterectomi to cure insan in woman and would never have practic anyth a liber a repres in the film i think it s laughabl to see various film critic who write for legitim newspap who say this film ha some histor basi the onli actual fact i can see is the friendship between dr buck and walt whitman plea don t wast your time on a film with such a disregard to the horror that real woman experienc at the hand of this doctor who ha now been glorifi by the film industri 
 
 
 
the script wa veri weak w o enough charact arc to make you care one bit about the charact or what happen to them the script is way too talki and not enough gore or action to even call it slow pace the stori get to the point that you just want everyon to shut up and die a quick a possibl so you don t have to listen to them talk this veri mute stiff dialogu on a technic note the music mix is way to high and make it hard to understand what is be said most time then again this could be call a bless overal this same stori could have better been told in a short film w a run time under minut the obvious in your face homag to sam raimi and evil dead would have been good had they been more subtl but here they seem more like a bald face rip off c mon this kind of mm budget and this is the best that could be done still the cinematographi light design and shot were veri well done inde 
 
 
 
it s kind of fascin to me that so mani review consid this a masterpiec i am not a dullard a far a qualiti film go and i will agre that from a technic film standpoint a well a for sever of the charact portray the film is in an award worthi class but there is no sen for me of this film actual go anywher i mean take the viewer anywher it is a seri of mood scene perhap remark a such but i want more from a film i look for stori and movement and a fulfil of arriv none of which did i find in this film yes it might be consid poetri on film but there is much poetri that i cannot live with for the same reason that it paint pictur without go anywher one thing further to be said is that it document a mid centuri english childhood which is necessarili limit in it univers i wa person appal at what a young british boy had to live through in that time and place have grown up in america just a decad earlier i can authorit say that the contrast is immens i cannot help wonder if this contrast ha had some effect on those review the film so favor in other word could there be a tendenc to judg the film entir on it filmic magic which i acknowledg is there and complet ignor it lack of relev to the natur of one s actual recal experi

christoph lambert is annoy and disappoint in his portray a gideon this movi could have been a classic had lambert perform a well a tom hank in forrest gump or dustin hoffman a raymond babbitt in rain man or sean penn a sam dawson in i am sam too bad becaus the stori line is meaning to u in life the support perform by charlton heston carrol o connor shirley jone mike connor and shelley winter were excel of 
 
 
 
the stori line ha been rehash a number of time a breath of life in the retir home sever play movi novel short stori poem and news articl have beat the subject to no end but it s still an excel platform for charact studi if gideon wa craft more enthusiast it could be brilliant but the dialogu is pain bore and the stori is absolut flood with clich even the subtitl and summari of gideon s simpl wisdom almost made me laugh in it ineffect most indiffer act is the final straw for this weak film but the rest of it is bland enough to make the actor lack of focus almost irrelev

okay let me coin a new word here polyphobia the fear of polyamor relationship this is yet anoth in a long line of movi which start out by titil audienc about some kind of threesom onli to turn on a dime and go all preachi about how it is oh so necessari and the onli moral thing to find a monogamist solut onli one person in a thousand understand the delight of be abl to love more than one person and this director is not one of them bleh mark my word a few decad from now polyphobia is go to be just a big a faux pa a homophobia but guess who wa too close mind to realiz this right the first time the produc of this movi and so mani like it whi even make a ridicul conserv and old fashion type of movi like this pride itself on be limitless open mind about gay it complet overlook the fact that we live in an age where monogami is turn into sequenti monogami which in turn in turn into swing and polyamori open your eye peopl plea this is a disappoint run of the mill chick flick but damn i gotta say heather graham is the cutest thing aliv out of 
 
 
 
it is import not to be insult by lack of logic or common sen and those who have ani gray matter will agre that this movi just doesn t work the problem lay in the direct cast select and lack of depth in the charact build the word comedi wa veri hard thing to say when i expect to laugh when these word are use let s look at the problem in direct script brother and sister both in their mid s seem to be well adjust they meet a complet stranger at a park and heather graham charact walk up to her and ask the most intim question that even half sane person would be run the other way or at least scream for a polic offic he then awkward walk over and make some stupid statement and she fall for him then after one date were they all go out togeth he fall in love with her and decid to get marri in vega in a week s time hello doe anyon feel stupid yet he goe out with thousand of woman and he meet this one person who say about word that we see on the screen and he want to marri her not onli wa there no chemistri it just doesn t make sen sure it s a romant comedi and i want to believ it could but the direct made it complet flat now heather fall head over heel with her too and when heather graham and bridget moynahan veri shallow charact kiss or more to the point it wa sloppiest kiss ever that chemistri might be there i found it unromant and unfunni and while mani say heather cannot act i think the realiti is heather wa clear the wrong person for this role this wa sue kramer debut a a director and to me it wa just too much for her to chew it would take a lot of craft to make this movi work and imho it could be done with better writer and cast and direct 
 
 
 
i had to walk out on this film fifteen minut from the end have pas through the cring stage and into pure boredom what realli horrifi me i mean truli disturb me is that there are peopl refer to this aimless drivel a delight or a must see i would feel deep piti for those so afflict were it not for the distinct impress that most of the posit comment about this shallow and humourless travesti were written by industri plant the truth is this is a lame film that doe noth to entertain nor enlighten it is decid unfunni poor script and ha all the pace and energi of cold can rice pud to be kind to m kramer the best one can say is it wa a miss opportun for have read the synopsi befor i watch it i had expect someth more challeng the possibl misinterpret of a close brother and sister co depend the unexpect awaken of sister sexual and the comic potenti in such sibl rivalri for the affect of the same girl were all obvious subject for refresh comed explor yet which at everi turn the movi frustrat shi away from instead the audienc is subject to a meander seri of uninspir and insipid drawn situat with clich d characteris and dull perform from a cast struggl for belief and obvious in need of much tighter direct the lack of directori control seem astound on the one hand moynahan cavanagh and spacek all give veri pedestrian perform while heather graham and molli shannon the latter in particular veer toward embarrass over compens at time one could lay the blame for this on the director mayb sue kramer hope that if her actor over act they will forc a bigger laugh from the audienc but then again the cast is a veteran one one would expect them to do better sue kramer realli need to think care what kind of movi she want to make and for whom given the possibl issu gray matter allud to and given her inabl or unwilling to fulli explor them in the context of a comedi perhap she should consid write drama instead i know it is never easi to make film about woman and woman s issu especi when one hope to reach a wider audienc than woman alon but whatev direct she take inconsequenti and flimsi charact like gray are not go to cut mustard

forbidden siren is base upon the siren playstat so mani s game like most video game turn movi i would say the major don t translat into a differ medium realli well and that goe for this one too pain there s a pretti long prologu which explain and set the premis for the stori and the mysteri island on which a writer leo morimoto and his child daughter yuki yui ichikawa and son hideo jun nishiyama come to move into the villag don t look all too friend and soon enough sound advic is given about the siren on the island to stay indoor onc the siren start wail natur and slowli thing start to go bump and our sibl go on a mission beat around the bush to discov exact what is happen on this unfriend island with it strang inhabit but in truth you will not bother with what s go on a folklor and fairi tale get thrown in to convolut the plot even more what wa realli push it into the realm of bad comedi are it unwit ill place out of the norm moment which just drew piti giggl at it sheer stupid until it s explain much later it s one thing tri to come up and present someth smart but anoth thing do it convinc and with loophol cover despit it clock in under minut i think it s a horror movi phenomenon to have that a a runtim benchmark it give that almost two hour feel with it slow buildup to tell what it want to thing begin to pick up toward the last minut but it s a classic case of too littl too late what save the movi is how it chang tack and it revel at the end again this is a common devic use to tri and elev a seem simpl horror movi into someth a littl bit extra in the hope of wow an audienc it turn out rather satisfactorili but leav a bad aftertast a you ll feel cheat somewhat there are two way a twist will make you feel it either elev the movi to a memor level or provid you with that hokey feel unfortun forbidden siren belong more to the latter the save grace will be it cinematographi with it use of light shadow and mirror but i will be that explicit it s still not worth the time so better to avoid this 
 
 
 
becaus some peopl like me like to know everyth about a movi even if they plan to see it includ the end anyway here s the end a i rememb it becaus i couldn t have been more than yr old when i saw it for the first and onli time on tv but i ll tell ya it sure scare the littl kid that i wa and i thought about it for day afterward and it still stand out in my mind to this day even though some of the detail are a littl vagu abe vigoda wa in this movi i don t rememb that i didn t even rememb that ol barnabus wa in this movi and i love dark shadow so at the end the lead charact belinda montgomeri is lure by the judg joseph cotton i m guess even though i rememb it a him be an old famili physician or someth instead of a judg see how memori fade to the wed place which a i rememb it is in a cavern of some kind mayb i ve got that wrong and shelley winter is there laugh and the judg ha a cape on and the camera angl is kind of look up at him and he throw back the cloak and he ha goat leg and he announc he s actual her father the devil and she s play right into their the satan cult s hand becaus the mortal guy she ha fallen in love with i guess that s robert foxworth turn out also to be the guy satan want to marri her off to the demon with yellow eye and yep sure enough they show robert foxworth and his eye glow yellow there are a lot of close up in the last few minut of the film everyon is laugh and rejoic except for belinda montgomeri who is veri unhappi and cri or scream or someth and that s the end the bad guy win

no doubt when madonna and guy ritchi marri it wa becaus they both thought it would help their movi career if you ve been through the ordeal of watch swept away then you know at that level it wa a match made in hell after near year of tri to becom a respect actress or octress a she might have pronounc it in the next best thing she still can t get out of herself long enough to turn in a perform that anyon with tast could even call decent and that s the thing that make peopl dislik her so much on the screen that gut feel that her ego is so inflat that it prevent her from be abl to just let go and connect with her audienc if there s ani justic in this univers she just blew her last chanc 
 
 
 
and forget this complet if you realli need to see madonna act rent bodi of evid at least willem defo is in that one in this film while the set are beauti you may want to mute the dialog you won t miss anyth bruce greenwood is wast jeann tripplehorn is a prop and madonna is so aw it becom amus whi they had to butcher the origin film into this mess i will never know guess they thought it wa bankabl madonna a an actress certain is not if you rent the origin film from though you will enjoy it and the actor in it can actual act 
 
 
 
for year madonna ha tri to prove not onli herself but the public eye that she can act unfortun tri too hard while fail to shed her own persona doesn t mix well she seem to fare better when she s not the star of ani movi if you watch her in support perform in desper seek susan or a leagu of their own she actual come off look good sinc the stori revolv on other actor the weight of the expect is taken off her shoulder by default the troubl start when she is ask to be the star of a movi regardless the genr be the focus of a plot that need to be told in a visual way whether it be good mediocr or plain aw she ha to emot in way that are akin to an actual movi perform a oppos to a video perform this is the crucial differ between madonna and let s say bett davi or meryl streep the latter two even if the movi were to fail becaus the visual storytel lack some effect in have u relat to it or becaus the script fell short or becaus the actress per se wa just not at her moment there would be an extra someth in their perform that would elev the movi from be a complet bomb both davi and streep have had their share bett have a longer career than streep in such fare a bunni o hare and wick stepmoth streep in she devil but at least there s been that natur in the way both attack their role that made u forget the banal of the movi and watch the perform madonna on the other hand not be an especi gift actress capabl of realli let u in on her abil to convey a persona other than herself fare much wors and even in the hand of someon a woodi allen in shadow and fog an inferior classic she in her pat screen time seem stilt and a littl stiff mayb even nervous a if she were awar of the camera and crew and just couldn t let go so here she tri yet onc again to prove she can act in what is essenti a two charact movi guy ritchi more known for action movi fill in masculin energi seem a adrift tell a stori closer to someon of the like of michaelangelo antonioni or ingmar bergman who could tell a tale of two peopl with incred ea and at minut the event which take place happen in such an unconvinc way that when the final half hour come along and the stori take a dramat turn it doesn t feel sincer from be an absolut witch with no redeem valu to sudden be in love this ha to be the most unconvinc degre turn sinc fay dunaway s laura sudden discov her passion for tommi lee jone in the eye of laura mar equal unconvinc is adriano giannini s nasti turn around the middl of the movi it lack ani humor and feel genuin psychopath and when he give in to madonna s love it s too quick to be believ film this in slow music and a visual montag of lovemak and beauti sceneri doesn t enhanc or add upon this transform from what would have been a stori of surviv between to unlik charact to a love stori where both discov each other tri to have an unsatisfi end work against the movi a well it onli make it drag bog it down and when madonna ha to be film go from hope to devast in a tight close up it feel she s tri too hard mani an actress have done better in convey so much do so littl her is a perform more suit to act style of the late s earli s where postur compens a act a part or an emot could the movi have been better of cours there are a myriad of way to have film it in a way that would leav the viewer feel that these peopl could at least hope to see each other again it s been done befor in overboard for exampl it could have had an existenti underton in which two veri differ peopl have to reli on each other but not necessarili chang to ensur a moral tone much dialog and unnecessari erot scene could have been spare for a more silent film look a in persona it could have even been someth of a thriller provid that the giannini charact have a mean streak a billi zane had in dead calm even if it would have been done a a sex farc it would have work better for madonna a the over the top uber control freak get her comeupp but with it mean streak humor without at least a glimps of her charact have a softer side that hide behind a mask of bitchdom and without realli defin giannini s own charact this becom anoth misfir tri to look like a battl of the sex 
 
 
 
this movi wa extrem depress the charact were so cold the mother who is he main charact is everyth but mother ok she wa unhappi in her marriag and alway put her husband and child first her husband die she then goe to visit her son and meet this hunk who is sleep with her daughter and end up sleep with him until this part the movi is all right not excel but it can be watch the guy is charm and who can blame her ok it s not veri mother to sleep with your daughter s lover but let s blame that on the shock of lose her husband she becom total ob with the guy i think this is the part where i start to dislik the movi she s alway there want to plea him in an old fashion way with snack while he is work on her son s hous i guess this is the onli thing she ever learn to do a if it wa the onli way she could get his attent the guy obvious is not veri interest actual it seem more like he consid sleep with her a charit activ and instead of be insult by that she continu to beg him to go to go to bed with her and to be nice to her when he becom veri abus i want to plea you she tell him in a desper way while he is insult her veri bad what outrag me in this movi is the utter lack of self respect the mother ha for herself she tell craig someth like i am just a shapeless lump the first time they sleep togeth this movi is an insult to woman kind if it had been me i would have bought myself a littl object that would have brought me the same satisfact and a lot le emot pain

i am still tri to determin whether the previous instal wa wors than this one or vice versa be that it is near fifteen year sinc i saw this film the fact that i rememb so littl about it doe not bode well perhap it is simpli becaus i onli watch it onc or twice but i doubt it if there wa anyth worth rememb about this film you can rest assur i would rememb it at the time this film wa releas the franchis wa still enter it die phase so a lot of medium coverag wa allot to it it s never a good sign when teeni pop magazin contain explan of the plot basic one such articl had to explain that freddi wa left too weak to infest the dream of grown human so he decid to go after alic s unborn son so far so good but this is the job of the writer or the director to explain to the audienc it should not be left to some unrel public make use of the trivia given in part three about freddi s concept one could half expect scene that would lift this joke out of the horror for infant categori but ala that wa not to be it goe to show the sheer idioci of the american rate system that a piec of b harni esqu garbag like this could get the same rate a a genuin frighten piec like the origin by this time the franchis could not attract anyon with an activ career fortun or unfortun depend on how you look at it lisa wilcox wa there to provid a quotient of compet act or perhap she just look compet by comparison to the rest of the cast either way given that her last role wa in someth call the all new adventur of chastiti blade i doubt she realli had anyth el go for her even poor old robert englund ha been in better product than that in the past fifteen year given that box offic return were in a steadi declin and not just for this franchis at the time one would have thought that the studio would realiz neuter their film doe not make them more saleabl in fact this particular film like it immedi predecessor wa so neuter that not onli did it fail to attract a new audienc both succeed in alien the core audienc that origin support the franchis despit this part five must be given some credit for not have the bright luminesc feel that made part four so insult to look at i gave a nightmar on elm street part five a one out of ten by tri to appeal to everyon or the mpaa s idea of everyon it succeed in appeal to noon like part two and four one could era it from the continu entir and nobodi would notic the differ 
 
 
 
like freddi s reveng this sequel take a pretti weird idea and doesn t go to great length to squeez a stori out of it basic alic from number is pregnant and her babi is haunt by freddi which give him an outlet to haunt her friend this ha the least death out of the whole seri and the wise crack are quit poor so neither the horror fan or comedi fan are happi i ve not alot to say about this it s moder interest to see the charact of alic and dan return from four but not worth watch a movi over uninsprir and unenjoy possibl onli the compet direct save it from be the worst in the seri 
 
 
 
star rate saturday night friday night friday morn sunday night monday morn alic have defeat freddi at the end of the last film is now tri to re adjust her life but her unborn child is carri a demon presenc freddi tri to come out into their world again it s interest to note the director who got their big break direct freddi film charl russel era the mask renni harlin the long kiss goodnight cutthroat island cliffhang die hard and here stephen hopkin lost in space predat but while russel and harlin made a good job of it hopkin imo ha made someth of a podg with this entri that should be quick forgotten the stori is clear be stretch a far a it can go here with freddi ludicr a father himself and the ridicul look demon babi even at about an hour and a half it all get rather tiresom and of cours not scari at all the bon appetit bitch catch phrase is the onli memor point of this other wise veri forgett entri

though not a fan of sam rockwel i wa surpris when i saw his name in the credit in the open of joshua heck i wasn t even awar he wa in joshua until i start the movi so it goe without say i wa watch the movi on the basi of the movi not the lead a sort of rosemari s babi the omen or ani other demon kid movi joshua wa bill unfortun it fell flat slow incred slow and flat yet i continu on to see how this would all resolv hope beyond belief the end climax would shed some light on the subject okay i admit it did a wee bit but what a stale close and what a low low budget movi or at least that s how they design it a person fall you don t see the drop you see someon lie down in what appear to be blood a person get hit by a cab you don t see it you see someon complain hold a bike up i m not sure if this is call style or lazi or simpli lack of fund for special effect we have a rich famili with a crazi mom a workahol father attempt to balanc everyth a kid joshua who may may not be the antichrist and a new born babi girl who cri a lot she cri a much a we see how mani day she s aliv and what wa that about are there rat abov or is it joshua is his mother nut is joshua crazi is he mere jealous of the newcom to the famili is he go to grow up to be michael myer or doe he drive his famili to the brink i don t think so they were nut prior and no so call act could make me believ otherwis unfortun bare ani question were answer bare ani open door shut i m sure that might have been the idea but for pete s sake give me someth anyth there are plenti better kid gone wild movi to explor joshua s more like the mini me of the antichrist 
 
 
 
i did not enjoy the film joshua at all perhap it is becaus i saw anoth much better similar film titl orphan day prior but perhap it s realli just becaus this film wa not veri good i am go with the ladder sure the plot of an evil child is not exact origin but that doesn t mean the film could not succeed it could have been suspens and entertain and chill but instead it wa slow build bore unev and realli didn t leav me think anyth more than that wasn t veri good when it wa all over at the end joshua s motiv are reveal i won t give that away but the realiti is that he didn t realli accomplish his goal sinc despit vera farmiga a his mother abbi disappear about th through the movi all arrow point to her return home soon she wa commit to a mental institut becaus she wa lose her mind but then joshua s father her husband wa accus of tamper with her medic which tell the audienc that the institut realiz that she wa inde not mental ill but rather wa be dose medic so shouldn t she be come home soon won t joshua have fail won t his mother be live with him and his sister and possibl his father soon i question the father sinc his futur is left open end at the end of the day i didn t care about the charact the evil demon child joshua wasn t realli scari the storylin move slowli and when it pick up it wa still bore suspens fell flat everi singl time when it wa over i couldn t believ i had sat through the whole thing just becaus the act wa good from the parent especi vera farmiga a the mother but if you want to see a movi about an evil child go see orphan now that s a movi that took an unorigin concept and creat a brilliant movi 
 
 
 
the act in the film is realli well done honest but the movi is so slow and so bore a soon a it get interest everyth slow to a major halt i am glad to see sam rockwel in this he did a great job so did the other actor a i mention but man this is one of the worst drag out film i have ever seen now mayb in a short film form this movi would be good but other than that avoid it this film ha so much filler it make a twinki cake jealous i never ever walk out on film but watch this one at home with famili i walk out yeah it wa that bore appar my comment doesn t have enough line to post so here s some more filler i guess i wa inspir by the movi i just watch

this may be the worst show i ve ever seen asid from the tasteless of have a sitcom about hitler it just isn t funni or entertain in ani way it is veri similar to a s sitcom in it cornbal humor and contriv situat but while it can be well done like in i love luci it s just not funni here i think the show wa base around the novelti look it s hitler a a bumbl sitcom figur but it just fell flat in everi regard the guy play hitler is so hammi that it hard to sit through that alon i wonder what could have possibl made the network think this wa a good idea to air i thought america had some tasteless show but the brit had u beat this time america would never air a sitcom about hitler although we did have that show about lincoln s slave the secret diari of desmond pfeiffer chanc are you ll probabl never see this show sinc it onli air one episod and will probabl never be releas on dvd

i saw this movi at the edmonton intern film festiv with the great dr uwe boll in attend the film is simpli put veri veri bad and no not in the usual uwe boll so bad it s actual entertain way but just plain bad the plot concern a man who lead a terribl life becaus of a past crimin record appar can t get a job and with an aw pound cheat wife this man turn to his cult leader uncl in a plan to steal a truck load of toy that contain the bird flu virus al qaeda also ha design on steal the toy and what follow is just under two hour of complet incomprehens sex and violenc the act is aw except for dave foley who realli tri despit it all the joke never rise abov child be shot in the chest in slow motion and peopl take a poo it s suppos to be satir but i m not sure of what think airplan but done by the creator of south park and without ani joke 
 
 
 
i m not go to wast my time write an essay and wast your time i would like to say howev that all those who are uptight about this movi even be made are be total ridicul johnnymacbest you can t play that card and i mean the nation patriot card to make peopl not watch this movi this is a movi that express it free will in this countri oh yea i play that card even though the director is german and deserv a slap on the wrist everi time he reach for a camera but the world is full of controversi and it the same thing you ve heard befor like the gta controversi it s a comedi laugh and be disgust not disgust all togeth it dark humor and obvious you don t have the heart to take it the past is past yes peopl rememb those who were lost but it time to move on that wa year ago you can still watch this movi and have good moral valu besid i m insan and who need a soul 
 
 
 
uwe boll ha done the imposs creat a game adapt that stay at least somewhat true to the game he ha turn a game full of antisoci and offens content into a movi full of antisoci and offens content so a an adapt it s a success unfortun it s still uwe boll we are deal with here so don t expect the movi to be actual ani good while it doe have it s moment postal wear out his welcom veri fast and becom a pain to sit through at it core postal is a satir on the unit state a done by a twelv year old kid boll seem to think that offens is linear proport to comed valu the more offens the funnier and the more exagger the funnier this result in a movi that set new level of tasteless while be extrem hit and miss yes some gag do work but it seem to be pure luck high point includ the director satir himself and peopl get hit veri violent by truck and other vehicl low point includ well pretti much everyth el after the initi surpris wear off postal simpli becom a bore to watch yes there is a good joke everi and good point ten minut but everyth el consist of hord of annoy charact shoot and chase each other all over the place for what seem to be an etern this probabl would have work a a short movi but it s just not enough content for someth that last over minut although it feel twice a long there are nice idea and nice tri but they get hopeless lost in endless and pointless action scene and content that is offens just for the sake of it 
 
 
 
although i am general a propon of the well made film i do not limit myself to film which escap those boundari and more often than not i do enjoy and admir film that success break the rule and it is quit true that director pasolini break the rule of establish cinema but it is also my opinion that he doe not break them success or to ani actual point pasolini s work is visual jar but this is le a matter of what is actual on the screen than how it is film and the jumpi of his film seem le a matter of artist choic than the result of amateur cinematographi this is true of decameron pasolini often prefer to use non actor and while mani director have done so with remark result under pasolini s direct his non actor tend to remain non actor this is also true of decameron pasolini quit often includ imag design to shock offend or otherwis disconcert the audienc such element can often be use with startl effect but in pasolini s hand such element seldom seem to actual contribut anyth to the film this is also true of decameron i have been given to understand there are mani peopl who like even admir pasolini s film even so i have never actual met ani of them and i have never been abl to read anyth about pasolini or his work that made the reason for such like or admir comprehens to me judg him from his work alon i am of the opinion that he wa essenti an amateurish director who did not break the rule so much by choic a by lack of skill and who wa initi applaud by the intelligentsia of his day for existenti bold therebi simpli confirm him in bad habit a a film maker i find his work tedious unimpress and pretenti and this too is true of decameron it is also sad true of virtual everi pasolini film it ha been my misfortun to endur 
 
 
 
though the titl may suggest exampl of the command it is a definit incorrect assumpt this is an adapt of seem unrel stori from giovanni bocaccio s th centuri decameron stori collect set within a mediev italian town s larg peasant popul it is a diatrib on the realiti of sex and it consequ within that world and time a realist view of life within this world it sometim feel like a journey back in time given the depict human element of it time one can also see the more adventur side of moral in it protagonist a well a the ironi of life at time or it may also be view a a general satir of the cathol church s rule noth terribl special but definit interest if one come with no expect or assumpt 
 
 
 
alright if you want to go see this movi just give me our money i ll kick you were it count and you ll have the same amount of fun i ll even guarante more fun this movi onc again show what happen when you can t get ani one el to hire your famili and your forc to make your own movi same i m go through puberti humor joke just dumber and grosser this movi is realli a disgrac to movi goer they tri to shock you into laugh becaus you can t believ the level they have to stoop to make you laugh so my offer abov stand as
 
 
 
i don t know where to begin so i ll begin with a snippet from the back of the cover of this movi aliv combin the tension of vincenzo natali s cube with kitamura s own versus i have not seen versus so i can t comment on that but i think cube wa an excel movi which i recommend to everyon howev in this case someon ha clear confus tension with boredom i ll just go ahead and spoil the entir plot becaus besid be one holi swiss chees of a plot it s also moldi chees and the movi is not worth spend ani time on even if you don t know the plot beforehand so it doesn t matter if i have misunderstood the plot don t hit me it s probabl becaus i had to struggl to keep my eyelid open so the american militari in nevada onc lost a ufo i the nambi desert this appar make sen becaus they re both desert so sure they re practic the same place differ contin or not a monkey broke into the ufo and acquir an alien someth which wa pas on to a japanes research who had to eat the monkey to surviv in the desert what ever the alien thing is now pas on to anyon who s bloodthirsti enough to kill the current host the japanes militari want to use it for militari stuff so they decid to make it pas from the current host the research s daughter to some other dude but instead of just pick someon out of the militari which is full of peopl who are bloodthirsti and alreadi on the militari s side they decid that it s probabl a good idea to pick some crimin out of death row instead oh and the reason they pick this particular crimin from death row is becaus he wa the first person in histori to not die from the non lethal electr shock which is the standard execut method becaus everyon die from the placebo effect when they get electrocut i don t know if they do this so they can giggl in the staff room at how everyon die even though it s not dead or if they just want to cut down the electr bill then the movi turn into what the matrix would have been if it had been realli lame and superflu fight bore u to tear for what feel like an hour and oh wait now they rememb that they alreadi had a dude who wa infect with the alien thing so the entir movi up to this point wa actual a total wast of time and also human live then everyon die the end the onli one moment in the movi where i didn t want to go away and sleep or eat a sandwich instead wa when a dude wa pin to a wall by a pipe through his chest and he s hang around up there and anoth dude walk by the dude hang on the wall say i m in pain shoot me and the live dude look at him and it s not like he s a mean dude or anyth so he realli look sorrow and doesn t want the guy on the wall to suffer so he shoot him rhetor paus in the stomach gee thank a freakin heap 
 
 
 
given that this movi wa put togeth in le than a year might explain it short minut includ end credit so rough minut of actual film but what it cannot explain is it lack of humor that the previous film posse the gag are quick and sometim not even funni the onli true funni part are the quick spoof on the nike basketbal spot jame wood portray of max van sydow s charact in the exorcist and bit and piec scatter throughout the film veri unfunni wa the take off of charli s angel which like the first scari movi and the matrix spin off scene basic recreat the scene without much humor inject into it today s youth might not be abl to relat to the spoof gag of the classic supernatur horror film of the s such a the exorcist and mayb of the s poltergeist et al hope scari movi will take some time to put togeth make the spoof more enjoy one thing though the film featur more than the last one of promis young actress anna fari whom i will admit seem except hot in the sequel just for her cast and act abil i give this movi a out of 
 
 
 
the script for scari movi just wasn t readi to go this is a problem with the film that is blatant evid to the actor and the audienc alik director keenan ivori wayan and mani of the actor are funni peopl and so the movi isn t complet humorless to their credit the film ha sever funni moment but a a whole scari movi is not even close to be a clever and amus a the origin the first scari movi wa a laugh a minut film it turn the smallest subtleti of the slasher film genr into comed gold the humor in scari movi is a heavi hand a it is un origin they even miss obvious opportun for parodi two of the movi star are former cast member of bever hill and this wa a show that wa beg to be parodi in the final analysi scari movi is like a fine bottl of wine that wa open far too soon the script need a lot more time to age star out of

i wa veri disappoint by this movi i thought that scari movi although not a great movi wa veri good and funni scari movi on the other hand wa bore not funni and at time plain stupid the exorcist amityvill spoof wa probabl the best part of the movi jame wood wa great now i ll admit that i am at a disadvantag sinc i have not seen a few of the movi that this parodi unlik the first where i had basic seen them all but bad comedi is still bad comedi someth that realli hurt this movi wa the time which ruin some of what might have been good joke scene and joke drag out way to long also the same joke keep get repeat again and again for exampl the talk bird ok it wa funni the first and mayb even the second time but it kept get repeat to the point of annoy the routin between the wheelchair guy and hanson chris elliott wa amus at first but it kept get repeat and end up stupid and even tasteless some joke even got repeat from the first movi for exampl the cream i guess you would call it of cindi anna fari wa funni in scari movi becaus cindi had been hold out on give her boyfriend sex for so long that essenti he had blue ball from hell and it wa funni when he cream her but this time around it wa out of place and not funni the bathroom and sexual humor in general wa more amus and well time the first time around the scat humor wa excess though and rather unneccessari in the second film torus spell wa annoy and realli had no place in this movi but i did enjoy shorti marlon wayan who in my opinion wa the funniest charact in the first film the scene with him and the pot plant wa one of my favorit from the second film don t get me wrong i love the wayan famili and their humor that is whi this film is so disappoint they have a lot more comic abil than endless scat joke 
 
 
 
scari movi is definit the worst of the film for there is not much of a plot bad act pretti tedious and some realli cheesi joke but and this is a big but there is one good actor one good recur joke and a good begin the good actor be tim curri the one good recur joke is the creepi weird butler with the disgust hand who alway doe cringey but laugh worthi thing and the good begin is the spoof of the excorsist the plot to scari movi is the main charact from the origin and a host of new charact along the way are invit to stay the night at a creepi old mansion but will they surviv the night this film is not veri good but if your bore you might a well watch it 
 
 
 
i ll keep this short a i know i don t need to say much aliv is a strang littl film that obvious appeal to some but i found it to be shock bland from almost the veri begin the film did veri littl to make ani of the charact likabl and the stori at time becam so convolut that i complet lost interest a i said i know other enjoy it but i found kitamura s aliv to be anyth but a lame extrem bore drama disguis a a thought provok action sci fi flick i felt like i wa sucker into watch this film base by it intrigu premis and uber excit cover art my suggest pas it up for kitamura s far more enjoy freshman effort versus or his riot godzilla final war and don t get me wrong i m alway up for a good think man s film but this certain wasn t it there wa nari a moment that i actual care about a singl event take place in this over preachi dialogu heavi movi if you wanna talk about someth talk about bore 
 
 
 
keenan ivori wayan is probabl one of the worst director i swear he ha no real knowledg on how to make film he ha made one brilliant film and that is scari movi scari movi wa ok too but everyth el keenan ha made are real disast avoid such titl like don t be a menac to south central while drink your juic in the hood i know what a titl obvious this film too just anyth that ha keenan name in the credit it wa an hour and a half on stupid nonsens that never made me laugh just trust me on this mayb woman might like this film a littl becaus of some of thing that happen but on a whole this film will never be like by anyon with a good tast in film j d seaton
 
 
 
i don t often go out of my way to write comment but for this i had to just to warn anyon that might think that by watch this they will see a comedi this doesn t come close while the premis chang in colour gender whatev is bad enough and ha been done better mani time befor the actual transform of two black guy into two white girl is one of the least convinc transform ever put on screen it would be bad enough if all that wa requir by the script wa a chang to white chick howev the wayan brother are requir to disguis themselv a two specif white woman a you will have guess by now they fail complet i have seen drag queen without makeup make more convinc woman than these two do with the best special effect and make up peopl that hollywood can provid it appal add to the mix a basketbal player built like a build terribl dialogu and more plot hole than a golf cours and this film hit a new person low and i like bad movi avoid like the plagu

i enjoy the movi veri much emot intellectu and visual it contain no violenc or sex or drug or special effect and doesn t need them one bit hold my attent the entir time with the visual stori and interspers word of wisdom howev [ ] some of the foreign languag accent made the dialog difficult to hear understand [ ] there is unnecessari overus of swear especi the f word which is the onli reason this movi wa rate r [ ] the movi is balanc with humor and emot but most of the emot that hold you throughout the film except the final resolut last minut is unpleas due to the exagger long last dysfunct reaction of some of the charact to loss live in the depth of bitter and depress for too long [ ] i will not recommend this movi becaus of second of background narrat which did not add one bit to the side charact it appli to or the film it onli turn me off to the movi and stuck in my brain through the whole movi and afterward the main charact s mother of german ancestri when watch old wwii movi secret root for the german there would be no local color or art if the nazi s won the war i don t know of ani german today except radic skinhead who think the world would be a better place if the nazi s won wwii

 st watch out of dir ewald andr dupont fair lame account of the titan disast is the first film version of this much herald event the replic of the disast is not bad but the drama around it is at some time silli bad act and way too soap opera like the stori is veri much the same a the most recent oscar win one except that we are shown how the crew tri to hide the actual disast that wa occur until almost too late good for nostalgia purpos onli and to get a feel for what jame cameron wa compet against bare in his recreat

this wa talk about to death by the critic when it honest isn t that great sure chao and insid man are liter the same movi just with variat in suspens but i found chao more enjoy becaus it wa fast pace kinda like the silli film swordfish the reason this film is more popular is becaus this got releas in the state and chao wa air all around the world at film festiv and foreign theater but ha yet to find a distributor in the u k and u s a it s true that this film make lot of tribut to classic film like dog day afternoon and other spike lee film but that doesn t mean that it is a pleasant film to watch watch it if noth el is on t v but you ll probabl get bore with after awhil 
 
 
 
i realli tri to like this movi but in the end it just didn t work for me i have seen most of kitamura s output and have found it to be veri variabl aliv like all of his film ha an interest plot some nifti sequenc and a fair amount of creativ howev these qualiti are in pain short suppli in aliv the plot is cool if not all that origin and could have made for a pretti ace film unfortun the pace is pain slow and the film take an age to get go befor reach fair predict place the action is just about passabl with the final fight pretti cool and the earlier one about ok the earlier one is also mar by overspeedi camera work make for le coher there are some neat visual effect and some interest idea float around in the dialogu but the film still drag bad the charact are neither well flesh out nor well act and the set and general color scheme is drab and bore the film is not complet terribl and ha some point of interest perhap judici use of the fast forward button could improv it with about twenti minut taken off the run time this could be a pretti decent sci fi thriller but the full length film is dull onli recommend to veri patient and determin kitumura fan 
 
 
 
the trailer for this film were better than the movi what wast of talent and money wish i would ve wait for this movi to come on dvd becaus at least i wouldn t be out the movi total miss the mark what could have been a great movi for all actor turn out to be a b movi at best movi move veri slow and just when i thought it wa go somewher it almost did but then it didn t in this day and age we need unpredict plot twist and closur in film and this film offer neither the whole thing about how everyon is a suspect is good howev not sure if it wa the way it wa direct the light the deliveri of line the write or what but noth came from it lot of hype for noth i wa veri disappoint in this film and i m tell everyon not to see it the cheesi saxophon music throughout made the film wors a well and the end had noth to do with the rest of the film what a disappoint 
 
 
 
this is a dumb movi mayb my judgment wouldn t be so harsh if the film didn t promis so much but i just felt like this movi cheat and play me for a fool at everi turn i didn t have ani beef with the act but i thought the charact were aw the movi start off with clive owen s charact tell u what a crimin mastermind he is and how he plan the perfect bank robberi someth he frequent remind u of later oh yeah he also tell u he s in a prison cell although that turn out to be a dumb metaphor ani idiot know that the best bank robberi is one where a minimum number of thing could potenti go wrong and you re long gone befor the polic show up but clive owen s scheme requir hang around the bank for hour for no reason but to stalk around and look scari a far a i can tell he also ha to control hostag negoti with cop and most fantast of all perform a this old hous job on the bank s stockroom and hide out there for a week i hope he brought enough food and a bucket to pee in and then sneak out again yeah that sure sound like the perfect crime to me clive this plan ha so mani move part that the onli reason it didn t fall apart wa the screenwrit said so and then there are the mani unexplain detail whi were the cop so convinc that the crook had accomplic among the hostag who the hell is jodi foster s charact and whi is she so import that she ha the mayor at her beck and call and she doesn t have to tell denzel washington her agenda becaus it s abov his pay scale how dumb are these cop that they can t figur out one guy speak in a foreign languag for hour is not the sound of a crimin gang plan a robberi how did the robber slip away and whi did clive owen stick around for a week how did they find out about the bank chairman s past and the number and content of his safe deposit box whi the hell would clive owen let in jodi foster or the cop sinc when do they make toy ak s that look real up close how the hell do you bug a pizza box anyway how did clive owen manag to sneak out of a secur area of the bank dure work hour undetect did this dispassion crimin realli feel bond enough to this cop denzel to slip him a diamond none of these question are ever answer there are film that achiev depth by leav you to wonder about event that happen off screen but i never felt that way about insid man it felt like the scene that explain these thing were cut from the movi or these question never had ani answer in the first place and that s weak particular annoy is jodi foster s charact who won t disclos what she doe but never seem to tire of remind u how import she is we re just suppos to take her word for it i guess the onli reason i gave this movi two star is i laugh at denzel s taxi cab and pina colada gag and at the kid s outrag video game other than that this movi ha no redeem featur

i ve seen most of ryuhei kitamura s work and i ve come to the conclus that he ha a knack for action scene are kinet and fast often combin element of martial art gun fight and samurai fight with camera work that effect captur the on screen carnag with versus and aragami kitamura demonstr that creativ and show that he his more than capabl of work with a low budget so what happen in aliv to be more blunt the answer would be noth noth happen in aliv it wa a two hour plus movi with littl to no action and littl to no charact and plot adapt from a comic book by tsutomu takahashi aliv is an examin of the life of one tenshu yashiro play by hideo sasaki a death row convict who surviv his execut he is then given a choic of either to repeat the execut or to subject himself in a bizarr seri of experi he choos the latter and soon after that is place in a room along with a rapist and later with a girl infect with a strang parasit that in exchang for it s host s human grant supernatur power naturali at some point that parasit move into yashiro the bad thing is that doesn t happen veri soon similar to aragami aliv set it s first half in establish the basic exposit charact are introduc their motiv are set and their relat between each other are uncov the whole thing even take place in just one set the first major problem of that comparison is that while aragami wa just a minut movi aliv drag on for more than two hour thus make the first part over one hour long that length could have been justifi had the charact been made a bit more interest but ala that is not the case dialogu is dri monoton deliv without ani sen of emot or depth charact themselv aren t much interest there were some small attempt at make aliv a bit more moral ambigu but in the end it all came down to the classic evil govern peopl against super power protagonist whom yes you guess it save the girl in the end like i previous said the entir film practic take place at just one set and after two hour that doe get bore even wors the set design itself wasn t even interest to begin with and doesn t do much to improv on other aspect of the film now after that first part is over one might think that kitamura would at least make some entertain action scene to make up for the bore begin sad that is not the case the two onli fight are actual rehash of similar fight from hollywood movi complet with bullet time effect and psychic power they re just not interest or fun kitamura s creativ from versus is gone the small set even limit his often veri impress camera work and it all boil down into generic and expect fight a shame realli evid aragami wa better on all account and kitamura had learn someth from aliv so it wasn t at least a total loss watch this movi if onli to understand the error made how to fix them and creat a better more entertain movi 
 
 
 
a fun concept but poor execut except for the fair good makeup effect there s realli not much to it there are obvious problem for exampl after take what seem to be week and week to get from fat to normal size the main charact seem to go from normal size to death thin in day and onc he s death thin he stay pretti much equal death thin for what seem to be a long time in ani case the movi ha far wors problem than that the cinematographi is decid low budget tv show qualiti and most of all the act is pretti aw all around robert john burk seem to alway be tri for some kind of weird snarl charlton heston imperson and is liter pain to watch the onli scari thing is that lucinda jenney and kari wuhrer are both even wors the onli reason whi i m give this movi a high a i am is that onc the movi enter it last or so and joe mantegna s charact take over the movi develop a fun campi cheesefest slaughterhous feel and the gangster s crazi scheme for torment the total obnoxi gypsi are somewhat fun to watch the end if predict is also nice mean avoid unless you re a king o phile or are realli psych up at the idea of the voic of fat toni from the simpson terror a gypsi camp 
 
 
 
so thinner yep this steven bachman read steven king yarn about a man who get his just dessert from a gypsi elder who he just kill the stori itself is there no doubt about it but i don t know whi i didn t enjoy it more than i could have i guess what realli distract me wa the actor i mean who s the lead robert john burk who s he and fer cri out loud can someon plea stop hire joseph mantegna for everi italian mafioso role there ever is and while we re at it doe everi mafioso have to have a pasta cook italian mother the onli good act job done here is under pound of makeup michael constantin a the gypsi elder he s pretti good but the rest i make you all better actor 
 
 
 
i began watch this movi with low expect a a matter of fact i onli notic it becaus it wa an adapt of a s k novel a novel i never read i m glad my expect were low becaus the movi wasn t noth close to good but it manag to keep you interest what realli drag this stori down is the work done by the director and the actor the movi is overlong hasn t no nice shot and no scare the dialog are dumb and the special effect are crap the onli thing good are that a i said it keep you interest i guess the book must be good without use much horror clich my vote 
 
 
 
i am not one of those who think king is a great writer his book are fine distract for a few hour and often have interest premis howev they in my opinion fall apart pretti rapid if you give them ani serious thought this film suffer from be a pretti exact re tell of king s stori if you have read the book there are zero surpris no chang no alter of scene or charact this is a film made by king fan for king fan for the rest of u there is noth terribl about the film it is a gypsi cur horror with it twist be the cur be someth mani peopl wish for to becom thinner the final third ha some sever structur problem and the slight forc end seem to break the rule of this genr a littl there are wors way to spend minut of your life but you might a well read the book becaus there is noth new here 
 
 
 
this move remind my of tale from the crypt keeper it ha the same sort of idea of peopl get what they deserv i think that s alway the them in a crypt stori the same goe for the bad act veri bad act i enjoy the movi know that most peopl didn t like it and i wasn t expect much whenev i watch a stephen king movi i don t expect much becaus all his movi are aw compar to the genius of his novel i have read the shine and carri and they were great book i love how carri play out like it wa a true stori and the whole book is a bunch of report and theori and such it wa so good but i notic that both of the novel were noth like the movi the end were veri differ then the movi version i assum from those two novel that all of his novel are chang great and the end are alway cheesi i end of thinner is the worst so cheesi i want to read the book to find out the real end i suggest everyon who intend to read stephen king s novel to watch his movi befor hand so that you may compar and that way you will be great satisfi in the book i intend on do so with all his novel that were made into movi i m sure if they were made into movi they were real good book and the screenplay went terribl wrong

this made for tv movi wa shown on a woman s channel natur a a man whi do i even attempt to watch this i don t know but i should have my head examin and director and writer simon gornick should be asham of himself to give men an injustic a he doe he take away ani strength and convict a man could have by have sever bore woman do him in number one bore is joyc hyser a the wife i couldn t wait for him to drop her her reveng wa silli and stupid and veri confus through most of the movi the other femm fatal wa nichol hiltz about the coldest person you d ever want to meet her look didn t warrant our lead man to go that ape over her and her act wa so obvious onli a fool could miss definit a loser tembi lock wa pretti good but slow on the uptak a to the slut seduc her own husband again play a a guy who is a loser by david deluis round out our cast of loser is anthoni denison a a bos who ha littl to do but scowl at our hero stephen jenkin a our hero or should i say victim wa not that good at first i thought he just a bad actor but later i believ it he never got the part off the ground and wa repetit throughout although a a man i becam enrag when the two woman got away with it men bewar of this channel that put men down and woman get away even with murder lmn is the channel bewar note have watch this a second time by mistak i am convinc on my initi thought especi on the writer director simon gornick i still believ he ha disgrac the male speci and should be hors whip onli save grace in this film is tembi lock who doesn t have a chanc to show her talent with the aw act of jenkin hyser hiltz and deluis around her plus the stupid plot that onli make it wors down with gornick s movi and his vacant star in it plea lmn don t show this trite again 
 
 
 
blow my mind how this movi got made i watch it while i work at home write email and answer the phone i onli watch it becaus i hope the reveng part would be good needle to say the reveng and the forc plot twist were not worth the email dure which they were watch in fact i m not even sure what happen at the end ani more the act wa a bad a re enact scenario on the fbi file show by far the worst re enact realli onli arrest and trial can possibl be a bad at re enact i didn t even know that the lead man wa in third eye blind until i look the movi up here on imdb but it obvious whi he hasn t made ani movi sinc i hope he is a good singer 
 
 
 
there is onli one reason to watch this movi if you are not relat to one of the star or a produc actress nichol hiltz she is the show in this slow move and wild unlik stori of reveng direct by simon gornick the film star joyc hyser a a betray wife who decid to seek reveng on her cheatin spous oh but not by convent mean she plan a total guerrilla war and recruit bad girl nichol hiltz a her weapon of choic she want nichol a tuesday to get close to her ex the handsom but dull stephan jenkin who should stick to music to embarrass him and ruin his life david deluis is good in his few brief moment and former crime stori star anthoni dennison is given virtual noth to do but scowl hiltz on the other hand come off at various time a sexi and play then evil and devious she also handl vulner and mayb a bit psychot well she s also quit hot though there s no naughti bit show so you can understand how she might be abl to get to ani guy she is aim at but the perform is kind of wast in this movi which is just not edgi or interest enough to recommend 
 
 
 
the onli reason i rememb this movi is becaus it wa and still is the biggest wast of time and money ever spent i wa and my friend wa we were the age when action movi were our thing to enjoy most ok nd most we walk out feel so insult we want our money back but the time could never be regain the edit is what kill this movi a the truck get attack by more and more vehicl with rocket launcher attach the movi complet insult the intellig of the audienc by have these rogu bad guy in x vw bug shoot rocket at the truck plea rocket at a truck known to be carri plutonium what s wors is the these vw s manag to get shot off of a rocket launcher you would see on vw with rocket fire of them cut around the truck with the last one attach come back a second later with two rocket attach fire anoth then go in front of the truck and now it s back to a full set of rocket we tough it out hope for a big finish that never happen it look like they just ran out of money and stop just ridicul 
 
 
 
just a warn this is the worst movi i have seen in year i couldn t watch it to the end it is a pure wast of time i realli feel sorri for snipe that he end up in such a movi there realli is not much to say about it horribl act incred bad line stori everyth the onli reason i would advis you to watch this movi is if you realli want to see how a movi shouldn t be just to tell you one scene the polic are search for snipe and they are surround the build with helicopt and car they are shoot around insid the build but still they are whisper so that snipe doesn t suspect a thing 
 
 
 
the u appear to run the uk polic who all run around arm to the teeth and did you know that cid offic chang into uniform when they stop work and go down the pub this ha got to be one of the most unrealist film with the worst portray of real uk polic that ha ever been foist on the unsuspect public i can see that mr snipe might have need the money to pay his back tax bill but what the heck a good actor like charl danc wa do in it is a mysteri wors than the wors low budget b film of the s an hour and a half of suicid and time i will never get back avoid it like the verit plagu 
 
 
 
a lot of theme or part of the stori is the same a in leon then other part felt like some other movi i don t know which but there are an familiar feel over the whole movi it wa kind of nice to watch but it would have been fantast if the stori would have been more origin the theme littl girl bad assassin from leon is just tweak a littl the open scene are realli good it is strang that peopl like to fight in the kitchen in the movi my biggest problem wa to rememb which part wa from leon nikita and if they where from the french or american version if you have not seen leon then this is a good movi if you like this movi then i can recommend leon best regard rick
 
 
 
i can hard believ that this inert turgid and bad stage film is by a filmmak whose other work i ve quit enjoy the experi of endur the ladi and the duke and no other word but endur will do left me in a vile mood a condit reliev onli by read the imdb user comment by ali for not onli ha rohmer attempt with success to make u see the world through the genr art of th centuri franc but a ali ha point out ha shown at the cost of alien his audienc the effect of both class conscious and the revolut it inspir through the eye of a dislik elitist woman of her time the director ha accomplish someth undeni difficult but i question whether it wa worth the effort it took for him to do so or for u to watch the dull result of his labor 
 
 
 
don t realli know where to start with one of the worst film i have had the displeasur to watch in a veri long time from the set which wa quit obvious and veri clear to anyon who ha visit london for even day will agre wa not london to the much unexplain way how snipe s charact manag to escap the countri back to the u without a singl problem then he convinc the girl and grandmoth to visit him in america how on earth did grandma agre to that he s an assassin well that s the end how about dure the film well unfortun that didn t fare much better we have british cop drive an amaz rang of car i m sure it wa an eighti vauxhal belmont which chase the taxi after the assign but a modern subaru imprezza escort the prison van in a few scene prior so or whoever the gun tote arm of the met they were tri to portray wa happili run around the street with their gun out chase after snipe s along with the cia there were child walk around but the polic were still state they had a clear shot to shoot him doe this happen in london no it doesn t i live there we also have the veri implaus travel from central london to the airport let s say heathrow for argument sake within minut of receiv a call we also have terribl american accent a young girl who s posher than the queen but live in eleph castl what doe it say for british polic when helicopt and a number of offic at snipe s locat can t find snipe s and he manag to evad captur by hide behind some stair the train station wa obvious not even on uk soil and the fight scene sound effect were terribl the plot wa also extrem poor bore and been written and film a lot better a thousand time befor but there were a few notabl actor cast in this film what were they think and plea don t let that sway you to watch this film this film didn t seem to know what it want to be if you are go to concentr on the dramat aspect from the aftermath of an assign then you need a strong rigid plot with plausibl sceneri and set this is someth the viewer ha time to take in and appreci and if you do it wrong then you notic it if you want an all out action film which this is not then continu and sceneri can be put to the side 
 
 
 
everi so often a movi come along that knock me down a notch and remind me that my tast in film i seek out to watch isn t alway impecc i normal would stay away from stuff like this but i wa dupe by some glow review and the rohmer pedigre there s an initi and intrigu novelti to the product where rohmer essenti superimpos the actor onto paint digit back drop of revolut era franc this quick wane and becom about a interest a watch the paint dri on a paint by number scene what we re left with is a bore and stuffi film about aristocrat in th centuri franc none of the charact are appeal or sympathet the pace is so languid the dialogu so arduous and suspens is clear a foreign concept to rohmer that i end up not care whose head roll who wa harbor who or what the devil the revolut wa suppos to be about the movi would ve great benefit from some semblanc of emot build up and a music score there s some fine classic music use at the veri end despit be so talki the film play much like a silent film and the worst kind of film at that a dull and uninterest film about infinit interest subject onli the most astut french historian will find anyth to take from this film a it dose seem to paint well known event from a new angl the ladi is english and a royalist otherwis avoid this yawner at all cost unless you are suffer from insomnia i doze off twice

it s difficult to know where this adapt start go wrong becaus i think the problem begin with the book themselv alexand mccall smith ha work out that you read them not for the detect stori but for his deepli condescend and complet spurious vision of an africa that doe not exist he s done for botswana what borat did for kazakhstan not a success but base in a much fact onc i realis this it ceas to gall me that jill scott an american singer actress is cast a mma ramotsw if she is to repres a land that is not africa how appropri that she is a black woman who is not african she s not the onli american on the cast mma makutsi is play by anika noni rose both woman are far far too young for the role they re play and far too glamor both brutal murder the local accent and both focus so entir on this brutal that they fail to offer much in the way of act scott s mma ramotsw is bounci cute and soft rose s mma makutsi is an annoy motor mouth bitch the result is almost unwatch the princip cast is redeem onli by the presenc of lucian msamati who turn in a decent perform a mr jlb matekoni he come off smarter and more intens than in the book but i find myself unabl to blame msamati for this he s a shine light in an ocean of suckag the contradict between his perform and the book are clear laid at the foot of whichev committe of butcher wrote the script to me mccall smith s write ha alway been high entertain yet notori bad he refus to be edit a a result his book contain experi in grammar that border on the scientif and charact that chang name mid sentenc it is therefor someth of an achiev that the write team on this project actual made it wors the dialogu is now larg anglicis charact speak of open up and sensit to need mma ramotsw and mr jlb matekoni flirt open mma makutsi moan about not have a comput but given her constant restyl hair makeup and jewelleri i m surpris she doesn t have a macbook in her handbag along with her visa card so what are we left with here it s difficult to be upset with this crappi adapt becaus honest most of the thing i like about the origin book are apocryph anyway mccall smith paint a fiction botswana popul with cute non threaten black peopl who are full of amus and palat wisdom nugget it read well despit linguist travesti but it is a vision of how a certain type of white person wish black peopl were it just isn t true given that it s hard surpris that this show suck a much a it doe it remain to be seen whether european and american audienc will even notic howev 
 
 
 
this reboot is like a process mcdonald s meal compar to ang lee s veri good but veri underr the incred hulk ang lee s the hulk is a comic book movi for the think person the hulk take some time to appear about minut but when he doe we see the conflict at our protagonist s core he doe his best to avoid lose control but a he admit when he doe give in to his rage he like it now compar this to edward norton s turn where there is no display of conflict in his person and he turn into the hulk whenev he becom excit and his pul rate hit beat per minut not not but exact to this review this felt akin to the introduct of midi chlorian in the phantom menac which tell how strong the forc is with one a if mystic abil can be gaug through a blood test in the movi all ed norton s bruce banner ha to do is to keep his pul rate under a monitor by a devic strap onto his wrist and for the record it is extrem difficult to get one s pul rate up to even through a veri exhilar run especi for a physic fit person emot drive eric bana s hulk he ha repress memori of his mother s death and his father s role in his earli life on the surfac he is calm but there underneath there is signific anger enough rage to fuel the hulk when it is unleash but the hulk never kill intent even his attack most he just want to get away or close to betti ross jennif connelli he incapacit his shooter and in one critic scene save a fighter jet pursu him from a collis in the movi the visual effect are there but a necessari the action scene and there are plenti of them are necessari to the plot unlik the movi where action is insert for the sake of action in his quest to turn it into a fugit stori ed norton lose focus on how bruce banner feel about the hulk to him the hulk is a danger side effect of an experi went awri and loui leterri the director pick up on ed norton s cue fail to add ani emot dimens to the banner hulk relationship the stori can be sum up a banner is pursu and hulk kick butt banner is purs and hulk kick butt repeat a necessari the onli thing that went against the movi is that it is perhap not a true to the comic book a the version howev even a i am a fan of the comic i would prefer a movi that is not a true to the comic a a fanboy s dream but ha heart over the comic loyal but manufactur and soulless version ani day perhap ang lee should have read more comic iron man also releas in is a perfect exampl of a movi that is true to it comic book root and ha heart 
 
 
 
revolut alway present opportun for dramat film sinc in fact most revolut are in themselv dramat event unfortun what this film lack in drama is compens for by an overabund of boredom one care not who win lose die or live just end it a soon a possibl this is due in larg measur to what seem to me to be a superfici use of background technolog scene of pari and the french countrysid have a cardboard qualiti about them they might better be done on a bare stage and left that way one cannot expect the amaz effect of the hous of the fli dagger or the golden compass but after all this is a digit master product charact seem to enter a scene for the sake of enter a scene so much so that one lose count of the number of time charact enter and leav room in my view this film turn the french revolut of the s into the papier mach revolut of a papier coll world 
 
 
 
i dislik this movi a lot if you ve read the puzo s book or at least have watch veri close the two first movi special the first one you re go to agre with me compar with the corleon s saga present by puzo s novel the script of this film is sometim even ridicul the charact and the relationship among them are distort the stori end up reach nowher although it appear to go to some direct dure the movi it is understand that differ time should be expect for the corleon s saga in the s and that we would not gonna find thing the way they were befor but in the other hand i don t know whi they had to copi some dialogu from the other movi in context when they didn t fit whi this it sound like those poor made sequel that just tri to copi the origin film s qualiti what will never be understand is the fact that mario puzo coppola and al pacino join togeth to make this a man who direct piec like apocalyps now and godfath ha to be forgiven for almost anyth he doe in cinema until he die so doe al pacino for be the actor he is but mario puzo shouldn t have written this how come he damag all his previous work what a shame my friend the puzo s novel the last don is a s stori about the mob and it is great we can never tell the same about the plot for the godfath iii

the godfath part i wa a stun look insid the fiction corleon famili and how an innoc young man wa all but forc into circumst he never want to have a part of the godfath part ii show that young man s accept of his new role his desensit of charact a well a his complet loss of all innoc a he dive deeper and deeper into a life of crime the first two part of this saga of this transform of michael corleon make for one of the greatest tragedi in cinemat histori then along came the godfath part iii michael corleon is now the age don of the corleon famili he show remors for his previous action not through subtl behavior but by tri to use his power for good and admit all his wrongdo and regret to other veri clich and uncharacterist of the complex charact that is michael corleon michael s plan to use his power for good are derail by an ambiti young discipl and his enemi michael s daughter is eventu a casualti of the ongo mob war and her death predict lead to michael realiz that his entir life a don ha been worthless for he ha fail in the one thing that wa the reason for put himself into the posit he wa in protect his famili the godfath part ii end with michael corleon reach the lowest of the low have his own brother kill befor part iii wa made the godfath saga wa an emot rivet tale of an innoc young man s journey into dark with the unbeliev tragic end of michael forget his root and abandon the one thing that ha alway matter most to him and those around him famili loyalti part iii paint the pictur of michael a a man who is and alway ha been just a victim of circumst this great corrupt the mean of the first two film the godfath part iii is a horribl mess of a film that never should have been made the onli solut to the problem that is this final instal of the godfath movi is to pretend that it doe not exist and that the saga actual end with michael s shock horribl act of have a member of his own famili kill

what a crappi movi the worst of the worst this movi is a entertain a a dead slug no talent what so ever actor stupid plot who wrote this script wa there ever a script for this goofi movi or did the director just accident press the record button on his camera and then decid to make the film up a they went along is this meant to be a kid movi or a comedi or what my friend younger brother is in the th grade and him and his classmat just did an amateur movi for their school project which outdid this geeki movi this is by far the worst film i have seen in my life there is just no excus for this flick 
 
 
 
i have never seen a movi a bad a this it is meant to be a fun movi but the onli joke is at the start and it is not funni if you like this sort of movi then you may just be abl to give it a vote of if it had the necessari vote it would truli belong on the bottom 
 
 
 
slim slam slum is a sad and disappoint pictur there is absolut no reason to this sorri excus for a pictur don`t go there what ever you do don`t watch tv shop for hour straight instead that way you will be slight amus 
 
 
 
the show had great episod this is not one of them it s not a terribl episod it s just hard to follow up the man that wa death all through the hous and dig that cat he s real gone this episod is about a coupl that ha just been marri peggi ammanda plummer and charl stephen shellen in the first five minut you find out that charl onli marri peggi for her money the two go on their honeymoon and their car break down on a dirt road and they have to seek refug in an old abandon mansion charl soon find out a secret of peggi s famili in my opinion you should watch this episod but just don t expect the same feel a the rest of the episod in the first season 
 
 
 
this wa one of the worst movi ever it wa so bad i wa laugh through the whole movi the plot wa so cheesi especi the end this movi turn from an end of the world disast to save the eel i mean c mon and i swear i think they use sock puppet for the eel and there wa this horribl kiss scene in the middl with the two main charact who happen to be divorc how predict it wa so terribl that my mom my sister and i couldn t finish it and when we did finish it it wa about a year later the second time we watch it and we finish it this time we did mst k like comment throughout the movi summari onli watch this if you re a movi basher make hilari comment watch this at a sleepov for laugh and i mean huge laugh also watch for mockeri the metaphor that explain this movi this movi is a veri shallow field full of chees and sock puppet 
 
 
 
actual had to stop it don t get me wrong love bad monster movi but this one wa way too bore regardless of the suspens music that never lead you anywher the actress had too mani teeth and that moment when she make contact with one of the beast wa way too obvious a clich this film total betray the cover on the dvd which look pretti interest from the cover one expect a giant monster but you get these cute not a gigant a expect electr eel move on to watch anoth film call the killer rat but that s anoth review deep shock wa realli crap a big shame consid the fact that it look pretti high budget 
 
 
 
i don t get this the movi obvious ha a pretti good budget it ha veri good cinematographi it ha nice pace good edit and pretti good direct too then whi oh whi didn t they hire someon to do a final rewrit of the script so it would not be so damn cheesi and whi oh whi did they hire such lousi actor that can t act their way out of a paper bag this movi could have been good at most time it look good and feel good but in the end you realiz that the movi wa no good at all so i would say it s a good product but a bad movi too bad actual and eel come one realli 
 
 
 
a mediocr sci fi channel origin pictur a littl squirmish but not much the nuclear power submarin u s s jimmi carter is on a mission deep below thick frigid ice near the north pole when it is attack by giant super charg electr eel a member of the crew simmon jade mackinnon think she ha devi a way to communic with the monster but is not given much chanc for vagu reason also among the crew are david keith mark sheppard and sean whalen this movi could have been somewhat better if the eel monster were not so cartoonish 
 
 
 
this is the worst movi ever made the act the script the locat everyth i would have given it a littl chanc if there were attract woman in the movi but even they were bad you would think that a movi with the word beach in it s titl would have good look woman in it wouldn t you 
 
 
 
is noth el on tv are you realli bore well then watch phat beach howev don t rent it and definit do not buy it that would be a big mistak i watch this on tv and found myself laugh at certain point i did not laugh long and i did not laugh hard howev there were subtl joke and comment i laugh at if you are look for an extrem funni hood movi then watch friday if you are look for a power emot movi someth that this movi tri at kind of watch someth like hoop dream or jason s lyric if you are lookin for some good black booti go watch a dominiqu simon porn flick becaus the nuditi in this movi is near non exist howev if you have noth better to do and this is on cabl go ahead and watch it you will be slight amus out of 
 
 
 
watch this movi wa the biggest wast of time and buck for rental in my life if noth catastroph happen befor i die this will be the biggest regret of my life who ever even thought about this movi or financ deserv a kick between the leg becaus that s where they were think when they made this movi it s about an overweight guy who is a hopeless romant and write pretenti drivel that tri to pas off a poetri he join his amor friend in a trip to the coast where they meet girl and such onli the fat guy doesn t get a girl skin flick don t annoy me i take em for face valu but this movi tri to be more than a skin flick it s about fat guy look for love in some girl but then meet anoth bikini silicon girl that enjoy his poetri he find his talent for volleybal which get money for his famili and impress the ladi onli he ha his ladi anyway the dialogu is super horribl for even a c movi it support a ton of black stereotyp no charact develop it s a glorifi porno movi without ani porn in it never ever watch this movi 
 
 
 
i watch phat beach on cabl for a while and i sort of enjoy it the fat guy is the best charact a he seem to be a nice guy the rest of the charact are just various stereotyp of young men and young black men i like to watch these low budget movi that captur a period of time becaus they are almost like a documentari of the year s attitud and fad phat beach is also funni becaus the low budget babe in this movi are strict home girl most low budget movi have that local babe qualiti and you can tell the babe in this movi were the local stripper and underwear model for jc penney some of them had so much cellulit hang from their bikini that it wa funni to watch how the youngster went wild over what wa essenti some realli over use high mileag skank there were some cuti too that is the charm of these low budget crappi movi you will see a lot of doggi and some real cuti i check up on some of them at imdb and seven year later phat beach is their onli credit too bad it would be interest if someon ever manag to do a where are they now book on all of the cuti that have appear in the histori of movi and then were never again to return what happen there are probabl one or two young peopl in almost everi movi who seem to have a lot go for them and yet year later when you see the movi again on tv you wonder what ever happen to x anyhow this movi most blow but it ha some funni moment 
 
 
 
it wa great to see some of my favorit star of year ago includ john ritter ben gazarra and audrey hepburn they look quit wonder but that wa it they were not given ani charact or good line to work with i neither understood or care what the charact were do some of the smaller femal role were fine patti henson and colleen camp were quit compet and confid in their small sidekick part they show some talent and it is sad they didn t go on to star in more and better film sad i didn t think dorothi stratten got a chanc to act in this her onli import film role the film appear to have some fan and i wa veri open mind when i start watch it i am a big peter bogdanovich fan and i enjoy his last movi cat s meow and all his earli one from target to nickleodeon so it realli surpris me that i wa bare abl to keep awak watch this one it is iron that this movi is about a detect agenc where the detect and client get romant involv with each other five year later bogdanovich s ex girlfriend cybil shepherd had a hit televis seri call moonlight steal the stori idea from bogdanovich of cours there wa a great differ in that the seri reli on ton of witti dialogu while this tri to make do with slapstick and a few screwbal line bottom line it ain t no paper moon and onli a veri pale version of what s up doc 
 
 
 
a a big fan of the origin film it s hard to watch this show the garish set decor and harsh light set rob ani style from this remak the mood is never there instead it ha the look and feel of so mani televis movi of the seventi crenna is not a bad choic a walter neff but his snappi wardrob and swank apart don t fit the mood of the origin or make him an interest charact he doe his best to make it work but samantha egger is a realli bad choic the english accent and california look can t hold a candl to barbara stanwick s velvet voic and sex appeal lee j cobb tri mightili to fashion barton key but even his perform is just gruff without style it feel like the tv movi it wa and again remind me of what a remark film the origin still is 
 
 
 
when someon remak a classic movi the remak is alway unfavor compar to the origin also there s a chanc that the remak is so radic differ that it is just too unfamiliar to audienc well the tv version of doubl indemn ha almost ident scene and dialogu a the origin the main differ is that the remak just seem to have no energi at all fred macmurray wa great a the lecher leer insur agent walter neff in the origin richard crenna just seem world weari and tire edward g robinson brought great manic energi to his role a macmurray s bos barton key lee j cobb a fine actor appear almost bore with the proceed samantha eggar is all wrong a the conniv back stab phylli dietrichson while barbara stanwyck wa just superb in this wick role eggar is over polit and manner and just seem way out of place robert webber in the old richard gain role a robinson s bos norton and john fiedler take the porter hall role a the crucial wit bring some life to the movi in particular webber recreat the norton role well in a s context howev after the movi start the whole thing just sort of lie there without ani life or electr this is one film that never should have been remad 
 
 
 
this tv remak of the billi wilder classic is inferior to the origin surpris first the good thing lee j cobb make a terrif barton key he s not a good a edward g robinson of cours but he s the onli reason to watch this this remak s onli improv over the origin is that it cut down the role of lola dietrichson the step daughter of the femm fatal phylli dietrichson and that s it for the good thing the bad thing are mani the director record everyth in an indiffer manner if you watch the film with the sound mute you d hard get the impress that anyth especi interest wa happen becaus of modern bad tast the film must be in color instead of black and white becaus of s bad tast all the set are distract ugli walter neff s expens apart in particular is hideous the modern set hurt in a lot of small way train trip were a bit more unusu in the s than in the s so mr dietrichson s decis to take a train seem more of a contriv men stop wear hat which prevent walter from cover up his brown hair while pose a the white hair mr dietrichson woman in mourn stop wear veil which rob samantha eggar of a prop barbara stanwyck made splendid use of in a key scene odd lola still ha the line where she reveal that her stepmoth wa tri on a black hat and veil befor she had need of them stephen bochco keep much of the billi wilder raymond chandler script the same but he make a lot of tini inexplic chang to the dialogu which leav the script slight flabbi where onc it wa lean and muscular outrag the famous motorcycl cop banter is gone but look close and you ll see what look like a post product cut where those line should have been bochco may not be to blame richard crenna is passabl a walter neff what might have made this version toler is a realli splendid phylli dietrichson instead we get samantha eggar who come off like a standard issu villai from barnabi jone but who can blame eggar with a director who bare seem interest in what s happen in front of the camera how could barbara stanwyck herself have come off well 
 
 
 
watch the origin with the same titl from this made for tv movi is just god aw although it doe use a far a i can tell almost the same dialog it just doesn t work is it the act the poor direct ok so it s made for tv but whi watch a bad copi when you can get your hand on the superb origin especi a you ll be spoil to the plot and won t enjoy the origin a much a if you ve watch it first there are a few thing that are differ from the origin it s shorter for onc but all are for the wors the actor play the part here just don t fit the bill you just don t believ them and who could top edward g robinson perform from the origin if you want onli watch it after you ve seen the origin and even then you ll be veri brave if you watch it through it s almost sacrileg 
 
 
 
when samantha eggar a phylli dietrickson answer the door of her hous swath in a towel you realiz that a compet an actress a eggar may be she doesn t have the hypnot allur of barbara stanwyck and it is not entir eggar s fault in the origin film wilder had stanwyck not onli appear in a towel but she enter the scene on the second floor balconi of the hous and she doesn t come out she appear almost a if by magic walter neff is stare up at her from below on the first floor there is a reason for this stanwyck is much higher than neff fred macmurray when they are first introduc it is not just the towel the towel add to the seduct allur her pose is like a greek goddess overlook her domain and in a strang way you feel a if from the start she is actual control the entir situat she ha sexual even magic power this person is no ordinari housewif this person is a mysteri with secret hidden within back to the remak ha crenna knock on the front door stanwyck s stand in eggar answer the door with a towel around her there is no appear she simpli open the door the allur superior that grab the audienc at the first appear of stanwyck in is entir absent in she open the door with a towel around her it may be sexi in a charli s angel sort of way but it s not near a mysteri the filmmak of the remak seem to misunderstand wilder s point the script may have said phylli appear in towel so the filmmak of the remak simpli follow the instruct and includ the requir towel the point is not the towel the point is the enigmat qualiti of phylli and the potenti power she wield wilder gave her a towel to add to her mystiqu the filmmak of the remak gave her a towel becaus that s what wilder did and in the choic of shot lost all of phylli mystiqu richard crenna also seem miscast he seem like he s act and not realli in the midst of the dilemma part of the problem is crenna appear so much like a s actor he can t get into the s when macmurray first speak into the microphon sweat begin to drip from his face no sweat on crenna and they also chang one of the crucial line at the begin in the origin neff say i didn t get the money and i didn t get the woman in the version crenna say i didn t get the money and i didn t want the woman did the filmmak complet misunderstand the entir point of the stori or were they dumb it down for a televis audienc this made for tv movi is a by the number rendit all the sharp edg of the origin is lost the onli stand out mayb is lee j cobb in the role made famous by edward g robinson but he cannot save the loss of intens of the origin this bore remak is a forgett tv movi made probabl by the same peopl who did gilligan s island they might a well have tri to remak citizen kane or gone with the wind if mediocr is the best one can hope for what s the point the classic is a film with a capit f this made for tv remak deserv an f grade or mayb a d for dumb

despit unfortun think itself to be a intellig b import and c interest fortun this movi is over merci quick the script make littl sen the whole idea of the sado masochist relationship between the two main charact is strang trite and john lydon show u all in the space of one movi whi he should never have let himself out of music his perform is one note and irrit the onli posit thing to be said is that harvey keitel manag to deliv a good turn his later bad lieuten would show just how bad good actor can act but merci his perform here is restrain 
 
 
 
this film wa shroud in scandal for so long that it becam a veri sought after item the outrag the mysteri etc it had everyth to be a great piec of film make but ultim fail in everi extent it s a terribl bad comedi a pathet horror movi a lame erot film the disc dvd includ a gorgeous booklet with still interview essay on bestial etc a well a an extens interview with the more than pretenti director for those who have heard about it but never seen it the packag will seem fantast until one actual see the film disc contain the edit film bad translat to english but with good visual qualiti disc contain the director s cut in an aw transfer in french what can i say about the actual beast a hand puppet of kermit the frog would have been more effect and shock 
 
 
 
encourag by the posit comment about this film on here i wa look forward to watch this film bad mistak i ve seen film and this is truli one of the worst of them it s aw in almost everi way edit pace storylin act soundtrack the film s onli song a lame countri tune is play no le than four time the film look cheap and nasti and is bore in the extrem rare have i been so happi to see the end credit of a film the onli thing that prevent me give this a score is harvey keitel while this is far from his best perform he at least seem to be make a bit of an effort one for keitel ob onli 
 
 
 
i thought harvey keitel a young fresh from the sex pistol john lydon then a a bonus the music by ennio morricon i expect an old school edgi italian cop thriller that wa made in america istead i got a mishmash stori that never made sen and a movi that left me say wtf too mani unansw question and not enough action the result a potenti cult classic got flush down the toilet keitel and lydon work well togeth so mayb quentin tarantino can reunit these guy with better script oh and the morricon score ok but not memor overal not a wast of time but not a must see unless you are a hardcor keitel fan

this and immor tale both left a bad tast in my mouth it seem to me that borowczyk is disgust by sex and these two film are cautionari tale about what will happen if you do have sex a a film it s not veri well done some of the act is truli epic bad such a the american woman with the french accent the young woman s sudden flip flop from be anxious about the marriag to be interest when it seem like it should have been the other way around and the aunt s sudden realize of the young man s secret don t make sen they re not explain at all i also didn t like how the daughter s relationship with a black man wa present a a sign of her famili s pervers or predilect for bestial the central idea the idea that there s this sexi beast if you will that live in the wood could have been a foundat for a pervers but fun stori but instead is just use a a basi for a nasti sex negat moral play

offic work especi in this era of comput multi function copi machin e mail voic mail snail mail and `temp is territori ripe with satir possibl a vein previous tap in such film a `clockwatch and `offic space and veri success this latest addit to the temp humor pool howev `haiku tunnel direct by josh kornbluth and jacob kornbluth fail to live up to it s predecessor and leav the laugh somewher outsid the door wait for a chanc to sneak in unfortun for the audienc that chanc never come so what you get is a nice tri but a the man onc said no cigar a the narrat star of the film josh kornbluth play josh kornbluth point out in the open frame in a monologu deliv direct into the camera this stori is pure fiction and take place in the fiction citi of `san franc l isco it s an innov if not veri imagin present disclaim and not all that funni it is howev a harbing of what is to follow all of which like the disclaim just isn t all that funni kornbluth play kornbluth an aspir novelist who support himself work a a `temp it s a job that suit him and it give him time to slip in some work on his novel from time to time but when he goe to work for a lawyer bob shelbi warren keith he doe too good a job on the first day and shelbi dispatch head secretari marlina d amor helen shumak to kornbluth to persuad him to go `perm the thought of work full time for the same compani though initi strike fear in the heart of kornbluth but he cave in and sign on for the posit he s nervous about it but at least now the other secretari acknowledg his presenc which of cours they would never do with a temp and if thing get too rough he ha seventeen import letter he s type up that now just have to be mail out to fall back on he s been hold them back becaus the mail is the easi part and he need that `someth easi to do in reserv in case it all get to be too much for him these are `import letter howev and by the end of the week kornbluth still ha them in reserv on his desk and it doesn t take a genius to figur out that when shelbi find out about it kornbluth s day a the fair hair boy are go to be over and quick the brother kornbluth who not onli direct but along with john bellucci also wrote the screenplay for this film should have taken a page out of the ben stiller book of comedi where it say `if you play it straight they will laugh but they didn t and the audienc won t becaus in comedi even look at it a object a possibl when the main charact a well a most of the support charact in this case `play funni a in he `know he s be funni he never is and that s exact what kornbluth doe here so rather than be `funni he come across a insincer and pretenti a grievous error in judgment on the part of the kornbluth becaus by allow it they sabotag their own movi in tri to discern exact whi this movi doesn t work it come down to two basic reason the direct which if not necessarili `bad is at least careless and second the perform begin with that of josh kornbluth quit simpli kornbluth just seem too impress with himself to be effect here unlik stiller or even steve martin both of whom use self deprec humor veri effect kornbluth appar ha an ego that simpli will not allow put himself in that light he seem to have a need to let his audienc know that he the real kornbluth is in realiti much more clever than kornbluth the charact and be unabl to get past that doe him in a well a the film rather than give the million of offic worker who may see this film someon to whom they can relat or with whom they can identifi kornbluth affect a condescend manner that onli serv to alien the veri peopl he is attempt to reach so what it all come down to is a case of poor direct and unconvinc act and when you take into consider that the screenplay itself wa weak to begin with with an inexplic narrow focus given the potenti of the rich subject matter it s easi to understand whi this one just doesn t fli the one save grace of the film is the perform by warren keith a shelbi whose subtl deliveri is convinc and which in and of itself is fair humor the effect of it is diminish howev inasmuch a keith ha to share his scene with kornbluth which somewhat automat cancel out his posit contribut to the project shumak and sarah overman juli faustino also manag to keep their head abov water with their respect perform which are commend if not entir memor they at least make their scene watchabl and overman even manag to elev kornbluth s perform if onli momentarili but it s still not enough to save the day or the film the support cast includ ami resnick mindi brian thorstenson clifford june lomena davonn joe bellan jimmi the mail clerk with a cameo appear by a dishevel look harri shearer a the orient leader a role that beg for an answer to the question `what wa he think when he agre to this in ani work environ there will forev be situat aris that one way or anoth will unavoid becom fodder for someon s comed cannon and the film depict said situat will alway be with u the good one see paragraph one may even becom classic in their own right `haiku tunnel howev will doubt remain veri long amongst them for it s destini lie elsewher in a realm known onli a `obscur i

this seem to be a good movi i thought it would be a good movi and throughout the movi i wa hope it would be a meaning use of my time and yes i have to admit that the act talent of dimpl kapadia and deepti naval where truli commend but despit the best effort this movi fall short of effect convey a meaning messag which it seem is it seem wa what somnath sen is tri to do the final point come short and the end seem kind of unsatisfactori after all that happen a bit like real life in that respect but movi unlik real life end in about hr and the end should leav the audienc satisfi if inde that wa the director s intent this fall short in that respect and that is what disappoint me the most anoth aspect that concern me wa the nation stereo type of the american charact they all seem to be carv out of the same block seem to me that most american charact in indian english movi are base upon how common indian themselv perceiv american to be like and it is clear that no effort ha been made to bring ani sen of depth or complex to ani american in the movi these two aspect put togeth they make for a disappoint stori

my kid make better video than this i feel rip off of the spent rent this thing there is no date on the video case appar design by wellspr and what s even wors there s no product date for the origin film list anywher in the movi the onli date given is lead an unsuspect renter to believ he s get a recent film this movi wa so bad from a standpoint of be outdat and irrelev for ani time period but precis when it wa made that i m amaz that anyon would take the time and expens to market it a a video it might be of interest to student studi the counter cultur of the s the anti war anti establish tune in turn on and drop out cultur but when you read the back of the video case there s no hint that that is what you re get if you do make the mistak of rent it though it is probabl best view while on drug so that your mind will more close match the wavelength of the mind of the director fassbind and fengler regardless of your state of mind while watch it i can tell you that it doesn t get ani better after the first scene so know that i m sure you ll be fast asleep long befor the end 
 
 
 
billi chung siu hung s the bloodi swordplay film assassin from film love to kill hong kong is among the strongest product of the categori iii boom that inhabit the hk cinema in earli nineti it consist of film with strong sex nuditi and violenc more or le gratuit and shock valu onli love to kill definit belong to the more categori with some unforgett idea and piec of celluloid sick the hk psycho anthoni wong from the award win the untold stori by herman yau from the same year play a busi man and a husband who like to tortur humili and rape his young wife elizabeth lee mei fung who for some reason doesn t leav him and save herself and their littl son from the disturb tormentor a policeman danni lee the famous polic charact actor from film like dr lamb by billi tang and co direct by lee and the killer by john woo to name just a few howev see the problem and start to protect the wife and the son but anthoni natur doesn t like this at all and lead it all into the typic ultra mean spirit and graphic final dure a rain storm the film is almost complet without ani serious merit a it s just a piec of exploit in order to cash in when these kind of film were so popular the imageri and happen are someth never found in the western cinema at least in mainstream and it all becom even more mind blow when some most taboo for western like violenc and pervers wit by a child are broken in these film so often that read the plotlin alon would make most viewer feel sick and that goe perfect especi for this film too the film still ha a rather interest and creepi soundtrack in the tradit of the mention dr lamb which practic start the whole boom in usual the music and soundtrack in hk film is interest and add to the imageri especi in these terror film also the cinematographi is worth mention a the film bath especi in the final in blue color and camera lens a doe assassin too and the rage storm is captur nice on the camera otherwis there s noth that would rate the film ani higher other than on the nasti meter the actor and actress are talent and profession and so don t make the film ani wors with their act still the film ha the usual hk humor in it which make the sick go on even sicker a some humor is thrown into the soup that includ some joke about danni lee s erect and so on someth that could never be found in the western serious film either and that thing usual destroy mane otherwis noteworthi hk film a the humor is just so obvious way and attempt to entertain the audienc and mass the film ha a veri high outrag level a it ha numer scene depict the abus of wong s wife in various way she get rape and molest beaten and kick by her husband we also get to see some flashback from wong s own childhood which turn out to be equal violent a his own father kill too and turn his young son into what he is now these flashback scene most at the end of the film includ also some total unexpect experi a the imageri is speed up for exampl the hit of an axe and that creat complet insan and mean spirit atmospher to the scene again someth that onli hk exploit maker seem to be abl to come up with the end itself includ plenti of sudden and shock gore a the madman wield his axe and meet also some nail for exampl on his furious way the film is also genuin pretti suspici in my opinion a the violenc and terror is realist pain and deal with thing that should never be taken a entertain most i mean rape the version i saw i ve seen two version includ a veri long and complet nauseat rape scene that just tri to be a sadist a possibl i m not sure doe the hk audienc realli like imageri like this but i think no one with some sen for moral in film entertain would never accept or make someth like it woman get brutal and kill in the most sadist and low way so that the fate of the men seem almost tame when compar to the femal the other version i saw the newli releas dvd in hk without subtitl ha this tabl brutal scene in a much longer form than the subtitl taiwanes dvd which is otherwis ident to the hk version i ve also heard that the old hk laserdisc is differ from these two and sinc the end credit are fill with scene and imag not found in the actual film it is imposs to say how uncut version these that have been releas or shown theatric are obvious plenti of footag ha been cut out possibl even befor the theatric releas the film is written by law gam fai and lau wing kin the former have written also film like dr lamb the untold stori and gunman kirk wong but out of his other film that i ve seen love to kill is the most gratuit dr lamb and the untold stori both are veri brutal and violent but have also some attempt to some critic toward the author and men in general a how it is easi to turn into a beast when chase or fight one the harrow tortur imageri of the untold stori the victim be the crimin is veri strong and definit ha it impact to chang someth that may be rotten in the societi and among the polic for exampl but there s none of this in love to kill it is just honest calcul and fast made exploit which is by the way produc by a veteran director kirk organ crime triad bureau crime stori wong love to kill earn no more than from me a i don t have too high appreci on film like this hk cinema is meant to be and can be more and film like love to kill are onli commerci parasit live among the real piec of the art

while it doe crack the odd good joke the humour is general quit dri with member of the panel frequent pull face or resort to coars languag and wait on the crowd to applaud lame enough joke unlik what an other comment say i don t think this is the best rte have ever made it realli dri and sarcast sarcasm is the lowest form of wit there are few truli funni intellig gag that would make you genuin laugh out loud peopl seem to be convinc by the comedian well known name rather than by judg the qualiti of the gag which aren t realli that good overal it mediocr with some good laugh to be had but often it can be fair mediocr it not a good a jasper carrot or dave allen stuff i find benni hill funnier

 big spoiler i ve seen one other takashi miik film and that wa the veri disturb and brutal audit which wa an examin of the japanes ideal of feminin in visitor q which i think mean visitor question he examin in a veri disturb gross way the famili unit miik s surreal vision of a dysfunct famili almost tri to be lynchian in term of confus and film make but ultim lack the style and intrigu we the audienc are introduc to a bizarr array of scenario from the open scene with the father figur kenichi endo who wa actual quit good pay for sex with his displac daughter fujiko then a the father return home he is struck on the head by the visitor kazushi watanab wield a fair sizeabl rock and for some reason they both end up back at the famili home the mother shungiku uchida is beaten and bulli by her son jun muto who is also beaten and bulli by his school peer when the visitor enter the home he somewhat menac establish himself a part of the unit eventu the famili begin to improv their relationship with assist from the visitor through milk breast murder and retain a sen of famili pride and there are other crazi scene that somehow bring the famili closer togeth it s ha uncomfort humour but is equal frustrat silli and over the top in it weird there is a necrophiliac scene that is utter disgust but end up be ridicul funni a the scene progress part becaus of the situat itself and part becaus you can t believ the filmmak and the actor are actual do this the style of the film is poor to say the least and the plot is stupid and unbeliev weak the charact themselv are all over the place and while i understand this is not meant to be realist there is hard ani interest in these confront charact and situat a all of them border on the absurd the camera work is sloppi and doesn t have that cinemat feel that lynch s work entail it s hard to take this film serious on a surrealist level or on an interpret of examin the famili unit in japan it just seem that miik wa out to shock and the film seem self awar that it s tri to be shock and it becom almost comic to be taken serious all in all i would say that this film is a bizarr dark comedi but it look and feel amateurish and seem to unnecessarili want to shock miik s previous film audit wa fine balanc between disgust horror charact develop and techniqu which establish more intrigu in the way the film wa craft to allow the viewer to becom engross with the plot visitor q is a step down a it tri too hard to be outlandish bizarr and intent confront without realli have much to say in the process out of

consid the risk of show same sex relationship befor the late s person best could have done better to play the same sex relationship between hemingway chris cahil and donnelli torus skinner a a more than experiment phase of cahil s life it seem to me that the creator of this movi threw in the same sex relationship between two fair attract woman in order to attract viewer also consid the second of expo the crotch of sever woman jump backward over a high jump pole this random scene had veri littl relev to the movi and it appear a though this wa done mere to keep the audienc interest in this bland movi i suppos the produc were tri to counteract the bore plot and the even more bore set of the movi the oregon track and field competit this review may seem harsh but it is the truth the exploit of young muriel hemingway s bodi and the same sex relationship ruin ani credit that i would have given to this film pepper thompson

i wish i could give this movi a zero cheesi effect and act the onli reason to see this movi is so you can see how bad it is let start with the kid who play brian what a geek i couldn t believ the mullet then there wa the talk to himself i guess they couldn t just have the movi be silent but still of cours they had to have him skinni dip too not someth i want to see but jare gave a great perform compar to the special effect depart everyth from the bear to the crash wa someth i could do myself and better i serious doubt that gari paulsen had anyth to do with the product see a the movi wa not even call hatchet final i do not think the writer had ever read the book see a noth wa the same i think the book wa great but this movi stunk like a smelli goat 
 
 
 
i had never read gari paulsen s novel hatchet for which a cri in the wild is the adapt of so i can t make ani comparison to the book i will howev say that a a film on it own adapt or no adapt it wa an underdevelop adventur that provid no major explan of it few charact think of a cri in the wild a a le luxuri teenag mountain wa quinci california the onli place this wa film version of cast away jare rushton is year old brian roebson a kid head on a small plane to visit his father until the craft crash over some desert mountain terrain leav the kid strand for quit a while and have to defend himself there are basic three part to the film the obvious be the ten or fifteen minut introduct of the charact name brian and his mom the next third of the movi which realli consum near all of the film is that of brian rough it these scene contain no particular amaz action noth spectacular other than lot of beauti cinematographi of a beauti yukon landscap noth to put you on edg no real encount except a brisk confront with a cub and no major dilemma to initi some sort of enjoy or connect with the charact on the screen you might even feel briefli bore with the passag of time a we wit brian deal with his situat through first primit mean and then more improv one use tool etc for his surviv it is more like the ordinari time that pas if you were actual stuck in the situat and that is pretti much about it in other word they put no meat on the paulsen s word when they translat them into a visual medium and of cours the third part of the movi is his rescu there is a subplot that continu seek to make itself known dure this time howev some conflict between brian and his parent that creat a rocki awkward relationship between them howev for the most part it is onli explain in brief intermitt minim dialog flashback that look more like a back stori for a music video ani minut the singer from jefferson starship should chime in an start sing sara other than what the viewer can draw from the implic or guess for his own need to fill the gap in the narrat we get a veri underdevelop back stori which wa probabl necessari to enjoy at least part of this film and creat a connect to the charact whether or not it realli had anyth to do with brian s surviv adventur in the third part of the movi these are the flaw in the narrat that through the viewer into a stupor a he struggl to find out what the heck those peopl there on the screen are do and for me almost done to the point of scream at the televis to say someth and tell me more it certain wa not for me a good adventur tale but for fan of jare rushton it wa one of the last few movi he made so watch it pure for nostalgia if noth el

this film is rivet but in much the same way a car crash is rivet it s hard to look away overal this film is noth more than an incred irrespons social experi and a futil bias experi at that the filmmak are manipul and seem to have no problem go for the lowest possibl denomin the manner in which the money is present to ted is pure exploit the interven step that the filmmak forc ted to particip in meet with so call expert were empti and devoid of ani substant attempt to connect with ted instead it s pain obvious that they serv to cover the filmmak s posterior and to further exploit ted s situat the worst part is that the filmmak stop follow ted after month and seem are cut off entir from the subject they had follow so close month befor if they had care they would have found better expert to help ted if they truli want to see what ted would do then they should have let him spend the money without ani intervent this film is at best a high brow jackass stunt and not a documentari it s sad to think how much could have actual chang a homeless person s life had it been put in the right hand

you all know the stori of hamlet i do well the to be or not to be phrase not the speech itself ha been beaten into the ground so mani time that it s not veri interest in fact it wasn t that great to begin with in fact i find hamlet a good but vast overr play it s not even shakespear s best julius caesar and romeo juliet are ten time better with a midsumm night s dream and othello not too far behind macbeth knock your tabl off his drawer puck will make amend ow isn t that bad either there are lot of other that are better than this by shakespear i won t realli comment too much on the movi rather i will dissect the utter horribl mst k episod okay mike and the bot win a card game get to pick the movi they ask for hamlet pearl send them this yadda yadda yadda and prepar for the most bore sci fi episod of mst k ever admit i haven t seen ani of the cc one while blood water of dr z make the view of that episod horribl sinc it is not realli a movi rather random splice togeth scene i m remind of mike s line from futur war mayb this is an antholog of short plotless movi the sol crew a lot got off a good mani good crack can t say the same for here the riff fall flat the host segment par usual are at best mediocr and when the movi itself which isn t that bad is actual better i mean a a qualiti movi not a camp like princ of space than the mst k version of it you know the show must be bad i laugh the last time i saw it wa sever month ago oh mayb eight or nine time throughout i tri and tri and tri to be entertain but i just couldn t onli the occasion line like hail queen dilbert s bos and when that s the funniest line of the episod well ahem and by occasion i mean everi ten minut or so mayb me even chuckl the second time i tri to watch it i didn t even laugh at the few joke i d found funni befor and simpli gave up forti minut befor the movi isn t horribl it s just a german version of hamlet the actor are good enough and though the dub isn t the greatest that s not in itself a reason to hate this film four star for hamlet three yes three for the mst k version p whi whi whi mst k 
 
 
 
ming the merciless doe a littl bardwork and a movi most foul 
 
 
 
i liter fell asleep time watch this movi grant it s shakespear and that take a certain mindset to be interest or not but this movi exceed ani barrier of long soliloqui and what not that may prevent mani from just not care about a shakespear base stori the largest roadblock to this product is the complet flat of the charact often dure charact s interact it s near difficult to distinguish who s line are who s grant i believ this movi is dub in english certain they could ve obtain voic actor which could ve ad a bit more drama to these classic literari line it would be difficult to rate this movi greater than although perhap that s base on prejudic of perhap age and what would seem a veri low budget still it s absolut pain and bore if you insist on hamlet do yourself a favor and read the book again 
 
 
 
poor will would be roll over in his grave if he could this this horiibl german tv adaptaion of his classic play it s obvious that veri littl money wa spent on it a stage riser a catwalk and some random place column pas off a a set the movi wa inept dub into english with the english voic actor occasion mumbl their line the whole product had an incred dark and dreari feel to it and just where wa fonterbra in this movi anyway mst k gave this sorri product the treatment it just deserv to be or not to be i wish this movi never wa in the first place 
 
 
 
i m a fan of both shakespear and mst k so i wait anxious to see this episod i ll comment on the movi first then the mst k episod the recip for this movi take talent actor rich and beauti shakespear materi and a budget mix well then drain of all life and movement until dull and lifeless serv cold in a big plain stone cauldron movi i give out of becaus the actor at least deserv a littl bit of credit okay now the mst k episod i ll admit it the first time i saw it i fell asleep halfway through i understand that wa the reaction of sever other veiwer a well howev when i watch it a second time i realiz that there wa a whole host of intellig refer and good line i miss the first time around the trick with this episod is listen care it take a coupl of view to catch each line give it a second chanc and you ll see what i mean mst k episod out of 
 
 
 
take a famous play a director with now idea of his own who is use a copi of the stage design of a popular theatr product of the play mention in an actor for the lead who ha no feel for the part he s play and you ll get hamlet prinz von d nemark i listen to the radio play of hamlet with maximilian schell a hamlet and i wa so disappoint i hope that the film version would be better that schell would at least have a bodi languag to underlin what he s say noth then the set the minimalist design is not everyon s tast but usual i like it when there s just enough on the stage to make clear what s the set and noth more ala that s on a stage in a theatr it won t work in a film base on a play that actual ha believ set that the idea for the set wa copi from the theatr product in which schell play the hamlet alreadi let s say if that wa the onli thing to complain about i ask myself how schell could get the part of hamlet anywher in first place and how anybodi could allow him to play hamlet a second time if you ve got the choic to view ani of the about sixti film base on hamlet don t watch this one unless you re a masochist or realli hardcor or like to poke fun on untal actor 
 
 
 
 this verson doesn t mangl the bard that bad it s still a horribl minimalist product hamlet s dutch uncl is inexplic dub by a spaniard whether it s ricardo montalban or not is subject to debat and maximilian schell overact like never befor most of the dialogu make it through unscath and the fact that the mst k version feel oblig to point out repeat that the speech are long duh doesn t strike me a incred humor most it s just bad act though

in case half of this film s footag look strang familiar it mean you watch way too much of this gori italian cult crap for you see the notori demigod lucio fulci did not onli produc this movi he also took the liberti of re use the most sadist kill sequenc in his own and more easili traceabl cat in the brain the open scene alreadi in which a prostitut is brutal decapit with an axe featur in fulci s later film and so do anoth hand of kill and sleaz moment andrea bianchi s masssacr fail miser a a giallo sinc the search for the sadist killer among a movi crew shoot a horror movi is all but compel and suspens but it s still good entertain if you re into cheap n shlocki horror trash the incoher script introduc a whole bunch of repugn charact who re all potenti maniac but none of the red herring biachi come up with are plausibl and you can point out the killer almost immedi whatev remain to enjoy are the truli misogyn make up effect and the hilari aw act perform of the ensembl cast whenev there isn t ani bloodsh on screen like between the first and second murder massacr is a slow and almost intoler with it inan dialog and thorough unexcit photographi thank in the second half there are woman get impal on fenc and male be stab repeat with rusti spike the music is crap and the use of film locat is veri unimagin my advis would be to skip this puppi and go straight for the aforement cat in the brain that one featur all the great moment of massacr and then some 
 
 
 
prior to this film i had onli seen two film by director andrea bianchi the trashi zombi flick le notti del terror famous amongst horror fan for it unforgett perform from man child peter bark and the enjoy sleazi giallo strip nude for your killer neither film wa a particular spectacular piec of cinema but both were entertain in their own special way and the fact that they featur plenti of gore and nuditi didn t hurt massacr howev is dull dull dull despit quit a bit of splatter and the odd spot of gratuit bare flesh the stori about a seri of murder in a hotel where the cast and crew of a horror film are resid dure their shoot is confus and oh so bore when the blood isn t flow and the skin isn t on show the film is a real struggl to sit through it took me four attempt to finish with endless scene of unlik charact bicker among themselv and do veri littl of note the onli point of interest about the film is that it produc lucio fulci use sever of it death scene to pad out his mega gori movi cat in the brain aka nightmar concert and if you ve alreadi seen that film then there is veri littl reason to bother with massacr 
 
 
 
massacr is a film direct by andrea bianchi burial ground and produc by legendari italian horror director lucio fulci now with this mix of great talent you would think this movi would have been a true gore fest this could not be further from that massacr fall right on it face a be one of the most bore slasher film i have seen come out of italian cinema i wa actual struggl to stay awak dure the film and i have never had that problem with italian horror film massacr start out with a hooker be slaughter on the side of the road with an ax this scene wa use in fulci s nightmar concert this isn t a bad scene and it rais your expect of the movi a be an ax wield slaughter unfortuanit the next hour of the movi is so bore the movi goe on to a set of a horror film be film and there is a lot of charact develop dure all these scene but the charact in the movi are so dull and bad act your interest start to leak away the last minut of the movi aren t so bad but still could have been much better the gore in the movi wa pathet and sinc fulci use most of the gore scene in nightmar concert there wa noth new here the end of the movi did leav a nice twist but there wa still to much unansw and the continu fall right through the floor this wasn t a veri good film but for a true italian horror freak like myself this movi is a must have sinc it is veri rare stars
 
 
 
kevin spacey is veri talent but unfortun direct is not his fort i had high expect about the film befor i rent it and mayb that is whi i dislik it so much i admir spacey s attempt at make a film that take place most in one small set but it s not the attempt that count i found the film dull bore and stretch out the act wa noth spectacular gari sinis ha done much better especi sinc he is conscious in most of his other film skeet ulrich wa disappoint but this wa one of his first film i did get a kick out of how young and chubbi this scream star look the onli thing that impress me about this film wa the one shot of the car wreck from abov the center line of the road wa perfect center and the camera move on along the line and past the wreck howev that shot wa veri usual suspect ish and my guess is spacey got the idea from that earlier film of his which is veri good mind you if you want to see a fabul film that take place in one small set watch hitchcock s lifeboat mayb spacey should have watch it befor film this 
 
 
 
a trio of low life crimin led by matt dillon botch a late night burglari they flee but quick cross path with the polic who just happen to be in hot pursuit of a terrorist of cours the polic mistak the burglar gang for the terrorist the real terrorist get away and the burglar are forc to take refug in a small dive of a bar take hostag unawar whi the polic are so intent on catch them and guess who el ha pick the bar a a sanctuari for the night unbeliev absolut and it goe down hill from there spacey did acquir a good bit of act talent matt dillon fay dunaway gari sinis viggo mortensen and m emmett walsh but they re all wast most becaus after all the charact get stuck in the bar all they do for the remaind of the film is argu endless and aimless long befor the conclus of the film you ve stop give a damn about what happen to them 
 
 
 
by dane youssef a gang of crook the perfect plan it all goe wrong they re in troubl the polic are outsid they re corner what are they gonna do now sound familiar the movi seem like it s tri to be a combin of the act workshop the indi film and the theater it s the kind of thing that actor love it s kind of like a workshop or a play becaus it most consist of tight focus on the actor act act angri ten scare convers scheme plan give the perform a lot of free rang to realli ham it all up a trio of crook one leader one goon one brother come up with a big heist scheme and a monkey wrench is thrown into the work to top thing off there s a bit of a fender bender and one of the crook in flung through the back of the windshield the cop are on their tail and they stumbl into a bar name poetic and leaden dino s last chanc spacey a a director tri to keep the focus on the actor perform and deliveri of dialoug he pan over to a bright passion red cigarett ad of a smoke and smolder bogart and he keep all the violenc off screen realli i think that wa a mistak focus on the intens and gruesom violent scene would have given the movi some edg the problem with the movi is that it move too slow and suffer from miscast in almost everi role matt dillon drugstor cowboy and wild thing seem too young and too idealist to be the leader of this gang gari sine seem to brood and deep in thought to be a spineless tag along with these guy and joe mantaga is effect a the tradit routin foul swear mad dog polic lieuten who s all thumb but he isn t given anyth to realli do here william fischter is the onli actor who is believ in his role a a brainless grunt who just want to spill blood and the crook are in a ten situat where they either go to jail or they tri to think of some way out of this spacey lack the abil to creat a lot of tension and keep it go the charact are most chat away tri to think of a plan and they re to calm and too articul there s even a scene where the crook are play pool with a whole swarm of arm cop right outsid readi to strike at one point one of the crook even call the polic who are right outsid the bar oh brother oh bother these cop are go to either blow them away or go to lock them up shouldn t the hole up crook be a littl scare a littl uneasi meanwhil all the real action is happen insid someon whip out a gun a basebal bat which lead to an ugli confront off screen and there s one more casualti that happen that s well kinda sad but fay dunaway also should have spent more time with a dialect coach improv on her new orlean accent skeet ullrich is fine in a smaller part a cop listen in reach for a pack of match at the absolut worst time is a nice look and so is a scene where someon goe right through the rear windshield the dialoug is obvious tri to go for a david mamet approach and it s a profan but never a realist or a insight the movi feel like too much of what it realli is a realli low budget movi with an actor behind the camera for the first time direct other actor from a script that s not bad but need a few more re write spacey show he s not a terribl director but he lack a sort of feel for shape a movi and it feel like he s just film actor act these actor are all talent and could work with the materi but they all feel out of place a i said befor the movi realli suffer from miscast i don t mean that the wrong actor were cast i think they found just the right cast but place them in all the wrong role i think switch some of the role would ve help immens have veteran mob actor joe mantagna play the leader of the pack gari sine a the angri polic lieuten outsid on his bullhorn give order and bark at his troop keep fischter in his bloodthirsti goon part and matt dillion a the sacrifici lamb that would have been a big improv when some actor direct it work they can even win oscar for it but a lot of the time when actor direct they have a tendenc to just focus on the perform just shoot the actor act sometim it work but they need a good showcas for it an excus for it hostag situat are all pretti much the same in real life just like come of age stori so it s onli natur that movi about them will go from point a to point b a well there are a few realli great entri into this genr spacey himself appear in a similar movi about hostag situat the negoti this certain won t becom a cult classic let alon one of afi s still it doe have a few nice moment and person touch but in the end it s instant forgett and the kind of movi that would play best on regular tv it s just not worth go out of your way to see i give a out of spacey s other directori credit beyond the sea wa report a better effort hmmm mayb it s true you need to fail befor you succeed by dane youssef

this movi wa bad from the start the onli purpos of the movi wa that angela want to get a high bodi count the act wa horribl the kill were act out veri bad like when alli got stuf down that toilet i guess it wa in the abandon cabin but when the end of the movi come and molli and the other guy are in the cabin you see alli so angela must have gone in to get her the part that realli got me wa when the black girl and angela were in the cabin and angela took the guitar string and chock her one it wa horribl act and two whi wouldn t you just turn around and punch the bitch then when molli is get chase by angela if you have the neigh whi not just turn around and stab her so stupid this movi suck 
 
 
 
this is an immor and reprehens piec of garbag that no doubt want to be a friday the th clone the poster for this movi make it look like there s go to be some sort of a cross between jason and freddi which is like to attract movi goer there is noth good or entertain about this movi about this movi it just make me sad just think that some peopl are go to stumbl upon sleepaway camp ii unhappi camper on video or dvd and wast their time with this sad cynic depress movi angela baker pamela springsteen is a camp counselor at camp roll hill who hope that the other camper are a nice a she is and that they stay out of troubl meanwhil the other camper are realiz that peopl are disappear one by one with angela make up the excus that she had to send them home could angela be the killer who wa onc a man who underw a sex chang oper year earlier who know who care the s wa home to a lot of movi that made the cross between the mad slasher and dead teenag genr in which a mad killer goe berserk some have a plot some don t but they re all about a bad a this one sleepaway camp ii unhappi camper is minut of teenag be introduc and then be stab strangl impal chop up burn aliv and mutil that s all this movi is it is just mindless bloodi violenc watch this movi i wa remind of the friday the th movi in which the messag for it viewer wa that the primari function of teenag is to be hack to death the filmmak of sleepaway camp ii have everi right to be asham of themselv imagin the sick messag that this movi offer for it teen viewer the world is a total evil place this movi tell you and it ll kill you it doesn t matter what your dream or your hope are it doesn t matter if you have a new boyfriend or a new girlfriend it doesn t matter what you think what you do or what your plan for the futur are you can forget those plan becaus you re just go to wind up dead and the sickest thing is and by not give too much away the movi simpli set up room for a sequel well whi not they ve probabl and alreadi taken the bucket to the cesspool by make three or four of these movi i miss out on the origin sleepaway camp and after watch it first sequel i will hope stay away from the other sequel a well a the origin and for parent if you know kid who actual like this movi do not let them date your child 
 
 
 
no wonder pamela springsteen gave up act to becom a full time photograph it s a much better idea to have her behind a camera than in front of one while this movi is not without it interest element mullet from hell etc it is outweigh by flaw for one thing angela the murder counselor appear to be about the same age a the camper have an older more threaten camp director would have done a lot for the film and then you have the murder scene the budget wa appar too low to execut most of them proper no pun intend although drown someon in an outhous toilet is certain origin but overal there are a ton of movi out there that are scarier more fun to spend an hour and a half of your life watch

sinc the s writer produc director charl band ha been respons for liter hundr of scienc fiction fantasi and horror b movi some of them are wonder exampl of how to use a tini budget to maximum effect mani of them are pretti bad trancer wa one of those rare gem a termin style tale of time travel and action trancer saw tim thomerson play jack deth a futur cop given the task of track down bad guy whistler who travel into the past by inhabit the bodi of an ancestor whistler is capabl of control other human with his psychic power convert them into obedi zombi the trancer of the titl and attempt to alter the cours of histori by kill off the ancestor of the leader of the futur jack follow him to determin to stop him in this sequel jack is still live in have destroy whistler he ha settl down and marri leena helen hunt the young woman who help him succeed in the first movi but for jack thing don t stay calm for long and troubl appear in the form of whistler s brother e d wardo who is tri to build a trancer armi trancer ii lack the charm and simplic of the origin and is a huge disappoint consid how good the origin wa the stori is difficult to pick up if you haven t seen the first film or at least not for a long while and there is load of unimpress action and a few poor special effect gone is the invent and wit that made trancer so much fun instead we get some cheesi one liner and a script that feel like it wa written on the fli about the onli reason i can give for recommend this film to fan of the genr is the cast which boast mani name that will be familiar to follow of sci fi and horror movi jeffrey comb barbara crampton richard lynch martin beswick unfortun most of them seem to be have an off day whilst film trancer ii and perform are mediocr at best the trancer seri obvious ha it fan four further sequel have sinc been churn out unless the qualiti ha taken up massiv upward swing i can t imagin them be ani good 
 
 
 
anni s wig doe not look good she is not cute and pretti enough to play anni anni stick out in the movi a her outfit look like halloween costum terribl act and terribl plot this movi is such a chang from the version i think that a younger and smaller girl should have had the lead role ashley johnson portray a veri boyish anni not appeal at all at least the cast director got it right with daddi warbuck m hannigan wa also miscast camilla bell play molli alright warn this movi might insult your iq so you might just want to onli show it to veri young child and younger some of the plot are too fiction and could hard take place in the real world 
 
 
 
not even worth watch this tacki spoiler ruin everyth about anni the charact seem almost cheapen by the poor written storylin and they low qualiti feel to the product it wa veri clear made for tv yet if i found it on my televis i would flick it straight over the child in the film do an alright job yet the adult act is unbeliev and so the movi fail to realli draw you in this film lack the music danc number that made the origin brilliant and truli doe take the shine of the anni we all love johnson a anni is at time annoy and over act you cannot convinc yourself that she truli is anni the differ in charact appear continu to irrit me throughout the durat of the film sad to say this sequel wa a total flop 
 
 
 
christ a sequel to one of the most cloy film of all time this at least ha the decenc to leav out the song bar a repris of the unbear tomorrow but doe continu the tradit of be nauseat and unfunni this time anni and her friend head off to london and get caught up in joan collin s plot to blow up buckingham palac or some such shite the movi ha a bizarr sycophant attitud toward it eponym charact at odd with how irrit she is everi time the littl bugger squeal leapin lizard i could feel my teeth grind themselv down into powder drearili photograph slushi and plod the movi ha onli one memor line unhand me you stupid genius and the fact that it s not the origin to recommend it 
 
 
 
worst movi with the best review given it i ve ever seen over the top dialog act and direct more slasher flick than thriller with all the great review this movi got i m appal that it turn out so silli shame on you martin scorsese
 
 
 
i m surpris this movi is rate so high although if i were to go with typic grade scale is a c or d so perhap that s all right but this movi wa just a typic thriller except bore slow and unrealist not that a typic thriller is realist but this one seem to be tri to and yet the woman who got rap didn t press charg becaus she didn t want to be cross examin in a court even though she would be put the man who broke her arm beat the crap out of her and rape her away for life not but also protect the lawyer whom she had feel for and his famili not just random peopl she didn t even know there were other similar problem with the movi which would have been all right if there wa some kind of moral to take away from the movi but the few moral question like whether it wa right to tri to kill beat kadi befor he did anyth illeg were present a littl one side sinc kadi end up be just a craze bastard bent on reveng so sure the lawyer wa justifi in protect his famili sinc wait for kadi to actual rape his daughter so he could do someth legal about it would be a bit absurd so now i ve just waist more of my life for this stupid movi so plea don t see it so at least your life won t be waist and that way my hour or so ha meant someth 
 
 
 
i realli don t want to compar martin scorses s cape fear to the classic cape fear film but i can t help it not onli am i a huge fan of the robert mitchum and gregori peck star cape fear but when scorses includ scene right out of the previous film cadi take the key out of the ignit dog die and even use bernard herrmann s score throughout the entir film he s not give me a lot of opportun to not make a comparison a i can t help but think of the classic cape fear near everi scene when compar scorses s version of cape fear to the classic version the remak come out destroy by the classic but even when take the film by itself it s still bad now scorses and screenwrit wesley strick didn t just remak the cape fear scene for scene they tri to do thing differ unfortun this is one of the film s problem gone is the origin crazi and anim like max cadi who is out for person reveng the max cadi in the version is a religi fanat out to save sam bowden and who is in touch with his feminin side his word not mine also gone is the stand up and strong sam bowden seen in the classic cape fear film the sam found in the remak is veri goofi magoo distrust and veri unlik even mr bowden is a complet differ charact she s crazier than max cadi is the overal stori ha also been chang around sam didn t testifi against cadi in court to put him in jail like in the classic version sam is now cadi s ex lawyer who cadi suspect of not do all he could to keep him out of jail and is out to save him the overal stori ha been chang and i don t hold too much against it but the overal script is also weak all around other sub plot have been thrown into the mix that not onli distract from the bigger pictur they are also just poor written the film also includ a few frank absurd scene and is fill with apathet and even ridicul line that you can t take the least bit serious these aspect take away from the danger and thrill natur that the film is suppos to have but they have some help in this depart a well now the classic version of cape fear wa extraordinarili film with brilliant light and a power effect suggest subtleti combin with a barefac brutal that deliv thrill when the film call for it and a sen of danger throughout it entireti howev scorses is unabl to do ani of this in his cape fear give the film a cooki cutter earli s look no sen of danger no suspens scene and littl style unless you count anim fire and the skylin style yeah there is some gruesom violenc and some effort wa put in to make this cape fear bigger than the origin but it end up empti and all shock but no awe if all that wasn t enough the act isn t great either robert de niro be somehow nomin for an academi award for his perform start off alright a max cadi but he get progress wors until he begin to get noth but laugh instead of scare by the end of the film the opposit thing happen for jessica lang and her perform of mr bowden go from overact for most of the film to give a convinc display of fear and desper toward the end a sam bowden nick nolt stay the same throughout the whole film beig juliett lewi who also reel in an academi award nomin is decent enough in her role a daniell bowden but she s call upon to play a real stupid charact and it s hard to realli like what we see on screen from her this film seem to be often count a one of the few good remak and i can t figur out whi i want to like it i realli did i mean if there s go to be a remak of cape fear i d rather like that one too but i just couldn t contain noth to be great on it own and be crush by the unavoid comparison to the origin cape fear i found martin scorses s cape fear to be a veri bad film inde the best thing about the film are robert mitchum and gregori peck in their support role go figur 
 
 
 
 look i know this may suck right now but pain is temporari film is forev whatev you do right now is burn into celluloid for all time and for thousand of year to come robert de niro this wa initi a film for steven spielberg the director hire sever screenwrit to adjust the screenplay so that it more suit his theme and so we have a dysfunct famili that is threaten by a derang monster in the form of a recent releas from prison robert de niro like jurass park poltergeist and war of the world the dysfunct famili band togeth to defeat the beast the beast be the creation of the father a lawyer who fail to defend de niro dure his trial in typic spielberg fashion the father kill the monster that undermin the famili and is then prompt absolv of his sin like oscar schindler robin william sam niel tom cruis and virtual everi daddi figur in spielberg land the father reclaim his patern duti in the kind of bittersweet coda that spielberg so enjoy but spielberg eventu abandon the pictur and the project wa instead turn over to martin scorses who at the time wa seek to tri his hand at more commerci fare the result is arguabl the worst film in scorses s filmographi and iron his most illumin an artist s failur or misfir are often veri reveal expo the inner work of their art when the stori doesn t work the charact don t connect or the imag don t sear we find ourselv left with a kind of inner core this the remain carcass is what the director s cinema is about now cape fear is an imperson film so we won t find ani themat connect to the rest of scorses s filmographi you alreadi sacrif me de niro yell but the film theme of cathol redempt are cooki cutter what the film doe though is expo the kind of languag that his filmographi hing on watch how scorses s camera desper whip back and forth how he zoom frantic onto doorknob and window in an attempt to forc tension and how his charact are all loud and scream for attent but more import watch how the film make no spatial sen a showdown on a boat at the end of the film take place on an obvious sound stage a street parad is claustrophob and take place within no larger context and the famili s hous doesn t seem to exist anywher in particular there is simpli no geograph sen to anyth in the pictur scorses unabl to film space or creat ani kind of spatial environ the reason for this is that scorses s camera alway ha to be bound or intim tether to his central charact for the world around the charact to make sen his camera ha to be focus on the charact resnai can take you around a french hotel well and hitchcock can danc you down a street and up a build cameron can give you a tour of the titan scott can recreat an entir futur cityscap luca can give you an alien desert planet and most other director can creat a sen of space by textbook close up mid shot wide shot combin but scorses can t do this there s no poetri no sen of tangibl space in his film he s all about the charact you break that tether you leav that box ring that taxi cab you look away from de niro and everyth collaps he simpli cannot break away from this veri documentarian style of shoot which in a way is a prerequisit for action film make scorses tri to rectifi this problem with gang of new york where the space and the set becom the central charact but even this self conscious spatial experi get sabotag by the magnet of daniel day lewi the actor draw scorses s camera inexor toward him like a moth to a bulb even a a generic b movi this is an ugli vulgar look film look at the matt paint the inept attempt at tension the silli rotorscop special effect and hokey fistfight showdown still we have robert de niro to pick up the slack de niro who give his bodi over to scorses like a tattoo christ give the film it onli great scene in an improvis romant sequenc with young a juliett lewi he stick his thumb into her mouth and kiss her a kind of symbol rape the girl run away both arous and repel by this man s interest but de niro s perform so delici over the top simpli can t be imit by scorses you d need the operat tone and the baroqu visual of someon like de palma to make this work but scorses nope worth one view 
 
 
 
the plot it s not so origin if someon saw l ultimo bacio there s noth new a wealthi famili in rome live everyday life that s is bore and fals with everyon ask to other what they think about them realli bore after an half of hour becaus it s simpl to understand where the stori is go to finish this becaus it s simpl to see the moralist view of muccino in this movi so even the hardest part seem normal to summaris in the first minut of the movi it would be enough and the aim of the movi were alreadi said the famili saw from a year old i don t like to see movi that want to show the realiti but for be coher to his thought ha to push more than the normal the situat realli good how muccino put the camera in the right place move with the carath and it s the onli reason that bring me not sleep in the cinema though alway in the movi scream from the begin perhap it could be good to see the famili how they are in realiti and not put the blame to someth out of it morant wa intens and great a usual but unfortunat on a bad movi

well what i can say about this movi is that it s great to see so mani asian face what i didn t like about the film wa that it wa full of stereotyp of what typic racial charact would do in their role the asian girl without confid who ha to play someon el to get ahead the white guy infatu with asian cultur and choos to leav his white world behind for the land of yellow and the keep it real black cab driver plus all the coke shanghai tang and dunkin donut product placement wa a bit too obvious the stori plot itself wa fun but pretti much how i thought the stori would unravel then again when watch romant comedi you can t expect much but then again i would have been want to just be surpris at least onc the parent are the best part of the flick 
 
 
 
in what i can say wa a theft of my time i wa taken to see this movi and i must say what a horribl experi fay ann lee is a terribl actress and is unconvinc in this movi larryjo is obvious a shill review the plot is thin to say the least the cantones dialog is not funni see this movi at your peril david tang from shanghai tang should be after the movi for the littl or no revenu this movi will generat the banal plot attempt to compet with other rom com out there and just blend into the sceneri it wa like watch paint dri in short this movi wa a total wast of time and space i ve seen better movi on youtub 
 
 
 
a low budget indi go you will usual find that you get what you pay for and let me just say i didn t pay much for frightworld writer director david r william bring u the stori of an abandon amus park besieg by the veng spirit of a slain serial killer not a bad premis but execut with a bevi of low budget mistak the camera work tri to be too cleaver for it s audienc by constant use shaki quick cut to cover the fact that they realli have noth gori or scari to show u this becom evid right off the bat a we are introduc to the would be killer and soon realiz that the act is the scariest thing happen after a pain long titl sequenc we are brought back to modern time yet the act remain the same frightworld doe generat some rather uniqu cinematographi when show sceneri from insid the fun hous but with an extrem long run time it can t save the film from it s below averag indi hell there is some mediocr nuditi but not much for gore which is usual the save grace for these type of movi fan of realli bad b movi might find someth of interest here otherwis don t spend a lot of cash 
 
 
 
veri bad veri veri bad a a fellow who aspir to make be in or at least sniff the cater tabl at a movi set i find it hard to critic independ who actual got a movi of ani sort made howev this movi oh dear realiz frightworld doesn t aspir to anyth more than crude exploit an honor thing in itself and to tri to make it conform to more mainstream standard is a mistak and to be fair it is more entertain than say red zone cuba but not by much so i won t tri to critiqu just let me ask throw out some observ if gore is the point of the movi shouldn t you be abl to see it if you have hire three sound men make sure at least one know how to oper the equip in a horror movi your lead maniac must be scarier than a smurf doll difficult i know but realli there is a lot of talent videograph in the buffalo rochest area most you can hire realli cheap get one who know how to frame a scene just becaus you have someon who know how to use after effect and other cool program doesn t mean he should do so everi two second kudo for get the girl to take off their top but next time get girl who s top we want to see taken off edit should help tell the stori or set a mood at the least in this sort of movi edit should sell the gore gag a chainsaw sudden appear in a charact stomach is not scari it s sloppi some good thing not all the act wa bad jack wa pretti good and i like acid onc she start fight back there wa some neat imageri unfortun it wa thrown up on the screen without rhyme or reason acid poptart is a name that deserv a better movi i like the moxi of frightworld too next time now that they have a movi of sort under their belt i hope all involv aspir to someth better than colman franci upgrad at least ed wood 
 
 
 
with the except of the sound none of the abov are realli critic for this type of no budget truli independ horror film make up effect and gore are veri good and the lead actor wa effect the lead actress although attract need some coach a she wa particular poor the major problem with frightworld is it s length at minut it half an hour too long to be effect a a slasher movi plot wise onli about ten minut of the first fifti are relev in place it is visual engag and sometim the lack of light work in the film favour howev when this is combin with the poor sound a is the case with most of the film larg section are difficult to watch this could certain be an entertain if unorigin serial killer back from the dead movi with some judici and ruthless edit in it current form it play like an unfinish rough cut 
 
 
 
i rememb when this piec of trash came out all the newspap were squawk about how it had taken barbra streisand year to get the film made well it couldn t have taken that mani year the play onli open in eight year previous it made a broadway star of the great actress tovah feldshuh who probabl should have been cast in the film but nooooo the great star barbra had to do it her way and with music no le this film is a total disast from start to finish for one thing barbra wa forti year old when she made it and she look everi minut of it there wa no way anyon could possibl swallow her a a young girl yearn to studi torah and then when she dress up a a boy it get campi i get the impress that streisand could not bear to be unattract so she play around with the make up she is prettier a a boy than she is a a girl and a if that is not bad enough she get involv with both her schoolmat avigdor mandi patinkin whose best moment is the shot of his nake rear end and his fianc e ami irv who doe her usual sleepwalk routin a bit of schtick the poor woman alway resort to when the director ignor her and she doe not know what she is do yentl even goe so far a to marri the girl i won t even bother to mention the wed night scene then there is the music nine total forgett song all sung by streisand via voic over presum a a look insid her mind and each one a intrus and irrit a fingernail on a blackboard i won t say that streisand doe not show a glimmer of promis a a director here some of the visual are love patinkin s backsid especi and she ha a good eye for balanc the problem with this movi is that she won t get out of her own way i did not believ her for one second in the titl role she should never have ad the song and on top of that the whole mess goe on for two hour and fifteen minut i wa sick of the whole sorri mess after forti five minut aw aw aw 
 
 
 
my person vision of hell is be lock in a room without the abil to close my eye or block my ear and have this movi play for etern on everi avail surfac in that room the whole notion that streisand play a boy man onli begin to scratch the surfac of how ridicul a premis this movi is the singl most import thing about watch ani movi is the concept of will suspens of disbelief it is imposs to do that in this movi 
 
 
 
this might be the worst film ever made and is possibl worth see for that reason alon streisand is laughabl unbeliev a a young woman pose a a man in order to studi judaism the soundtrack is tortur featur barbara belt out some of the weakest blather ever put to film and don t even get me start on the plot you will actual get more chuckl out of this film than mani comedi becaus it is soooooooo terribl the rampant ego of streisand think she could somehow rais this stinker to oscar height led to this disast i m pretti sure the novelist isaac bashevi singer hate this film and never forgav streisand i can t blame him this movi is like watch a car wreck in slow motion for two hour with the soundtrack of the sound of music be play backward on an old turntabl it s truli that bad i m amaz that anyon from streisand enjoy this movi on the level that it wa intend 
 
 
 
a seem endless movi that realli deserv a zero rate the premis seem simpl enough yentl a girl interest in studi the talmud want to go to school but onli boy are allow to studi so after her father s death she decid to disguis herself a a boy to get in she doe and becom close friend with avigdor who is to be marri to a beauti woman name hadass hadass famili learn avigdor s brother commit suicid and the wed is call off yentl now call herself anschel is then select to marri hadass she doe but it is never consumm yentl anschel and avigdor go away for a few day and yentl anschel reveal her secret to him the movi end with avigdor return to and marri hadass and yentl go to america to continu her studi although she will have to continu to do so in disguis the plot abov seem interest at first for a movi over hour long but there are sever thing that ruin it for starter there is the constant sing i can alreadi hear the critic shout yes i know this is a music so there are suppos to be lot of song and danc number but the movi could have been improv if it were direct and play without them the song becom tedious after a while and there isn t a much danc a one would expect mani of the song are forgett with no real memor lyric and those with ani signific could easili have been substitut by a voic over onli one song stand out from the rest papa can you hear me it is obvious that most of the other were deliber place so streisand could simpli have a reason to show off her vocal abil everi five to ten minut chanc are anyon who will see this film will alreadi know what a superb singer and actress she is so the song realli aren t necessari second streisand s makeup which can be seen dure her scene a a man the lipstick enhanc lash and trace of blush are all obvious make it hard for the audienc to believ in the yentl anschel charact that she is actual serious and fool her new friend colleagu and even hadass into believ she is a man yet we are ask and expect to believ that veri thing there seem to be a contradict a her charact talk or rather sing of how she doesn t think she can pull it off but is surpris that everyon seem to be fool becaus she is wear men s cloth this mean that we are then expect to believ the other charact are so naiv they can t see the other differ such a her action which are clear giveaway the facial differ alon cannot be includ a other charact in the film mention that some of their male relat or friend didn t have a beard or other facial hair nevertheless in the s if a woman dress a a man but wore a much makeup a streisand s charact did and still tri to pas herself off a a man sole becaus she wore men s cloth it would have been deem unaccept and caus an outrag chanc are she would probabl be forc to leav the town or even the countri therefor the feminin makeup on streisand doe not lend to the charact s credibl and onli weaken the plot if it wa onli appli to make streisand look more beauti it should have been scrap third when yentl anschel herself reveal who she truli is toward the end we are then ask to believ that the other charact are not a smart a streisand s and onli when they learn the truth do they becom a littl wiser by now it becom more and more appar that the whole plot is so far fetch that it is noth more than a custom made vehicl for streisand to fuel last there are those who are fan of streisand who will find no fault with this film it plot or the song to those i must respect disagre while she ha excel vocal and act abil i am not a fan of her style of sing howev i have enjoy mani of her other featur includ music there are even some song of her that i like so i am not a hater nor have set out to bash her i have written this review from an honest perspect from someon who ha tri their best to watch this movi sever time even and ha note the problem within if streisand wa interest in creat a great or even believ film she could have done so here by not inject her need to show off and prove how talent beauti and smart she is at near everi turn this movi doe noth more than hurt her abil make her appear self absorb and thus turn the film into a laugh fest unworthi of her fan or audienc

this is one of the few episod if not the onli one with an indisput error in it storytel while handl the ralphi situat christoph state that he ha heard about pie o my s death in the fire accid this is an import detail becaus in this context it is quit obvious that christoph know from the begin that toni is the one who must have kill ralphi there is howev no way chris could have heard about the accid who should have told him and when by the time he is torn out of his delirium by toni s call nobodi el wa inform toni know that which make it even wors hear christoph talk about pie o my s death could therefor onli lead toni to the conclus that chris himself ha set the fire given the impress elabor write process a told by the writer themselv on the dvd i realli wonder none of them realiz the problem there the stori just doesn t work that way unnecessari to add that i m a huge fan of the soprano otherwis i certain wouldn t care 
 
 
 
this film is aw the cgi is the veri cheap gray blob cgi the crocodil look like a larg gray smudg the worst is that no effort at all is given to make it walk or look like it is aliv it is most a photo shop cgi that is place into scene and you almost expect to see the hand that is move the cgi smudg across the screen this is one of the worst exampl of cgi effect that i have ever wit and i have seen lot of the veri bad sci fi channel movi asid from the terribl lack of special effect the cast is compos of the typic low cost actor who probabl work a waiter waitress at local diner while they wait for their big break perhap the most ridicul scene in this movi is when one of the bad guy is attempt to sexual assault kate and the giant crocodil jump straight up out of the water to the second floor of the villain headquart and through the balconi and pull the bad guy off kate and instead of crash straight down through the build and crush kate the croc just fli backward at the same angl into the water no law of physic can appli to this movi or the special effect at least there is honor among crocodil 
 
 
 
 spoiler spoiler if one were to review the film base on the premis alon one might think that you were look at an averag anim orient horror flick the plot is a follow a group of documentari filmmak head off to an island in order to film a documentari about surf with shark or blood surf i live in south africa so it wa releas a blood surf admit this seem to have a somewhat interest idea behind it which if it were explor further could have improv the movi somewhat howev this is not the case a the blood surf part of the movi is minim due to the fact that their documentari is interrupt by a rather larg salt water crocodil the script is absolut terribl a good exampl of this is whenev someon get eaten by the crocodil which is a frequent occurr in this film no one seem to give a damn the most anyon person did in the film wa to mere toast the victim in a scene which wa meant to be poignant but just end up be laughabl due to the fact that the dialogu in this film wa of a high dubious natur anoth thing that realli irrit about this film is the fact that they introduc charact who are total superflu to the film itself they introduc a bunch of pirat who can onli be seen to be ad anoth minut to a merci short film the act can be said to be mediocr it probabl would have been a lot more impress if they did not have such a terribl script to work from all in all there isn t one person who made a terribl impact on me everi singl person seem to be a water down caricatur and in this way not one of these actor made ani sort of impact on me the crocodil itself is said to be huge over foot exact and this sen of size is well portray by the obvious fake of a crocodil that they have provid for u in the film the crocodil s death at the end of the film is so ridicul fake and contriv that it make one s stomach turn with a huge cri of bravado the hero of the film announc that he ha a plan which turn out be fall down a hill and get the crocodil to impal himself on a luckili place spike at the bottom of this said hill all in all i would say that this film is one which ha to be seen for you to believ how bad it could be what probabl seem like a good idea at the time suffer from a terribl script and an overwhelm sen of low budget which all serv to creat a truli aw movi 
 
 
 
this film is realli terribl terribl a in it is a wast of minut of your life special effect are so terribl the act wasn t convinc it about a crocodil that attack a view tourist a they are film a documentari about blood surf blood surf is when they surf around shark but it turn terribl wrong when a foot crocodil interrupt there holiday the shark don t look real the crocodil is even wors and it get even more pathet when they are run away form the creatur but the crocodil get stuck and femal flash it the death are fake and the pirat are just to fill in time a pointless terribl film that not worth see

simpli put this is the worst movi sinc polic academi mission to moscow if you like that movi you will probabl like this one what were they think some idea should stay just that an idea the fact that this idea could itself to film should be a crimin offens what wa so bad about it i hear you ask one word everyth cost to hire cost in time to watch minut i want a refund on both 
 
 
 
i m usual not one to say that a film is not worth watch but this is certain an extenu circumst the onli true upsid to this film is cornelia sharp look rather attract and the fact that this film is realli short the plot in the film is unbeliev bore and goe virtual nowher throughout the film none of the charact are even remot interest and there is no reason to care about anyon i m not sure whi on earth sean conneri agre to do this film but he should have definit pas on this one the onli reason i could see for see this film is if you are a die hard sean conneri fan and simpli want to see everyth he s done save this one for last though well if you by some miracl end up see this despit my review or ani of the other review on this site then i hope you enjoy it more than i did thank for read 
 
 
 
the movi had a lot of potenti unfortun it came apart becaus of a weak implaus stori line miscast and general lack of content substanc one of the veri obvious flaw wa that sean conneri who play an arab man didn t know how to pronounc his own arab name this may seem a small flaw but it point to the seem lack of effort in pay attent to detail the qualiti of act wa uniform well below averag movi s solitari save grace wa the twist in the plot at the veri end and a french song i don t recal the titl overal it wa a pretti bad movi where sean conneri wa visibl miscast

this wa one of the most bore horror movi that i have ever seen a colleg kid ha an epidem of nightmar involv roam spirit at alcatraz tri to deliv a mix of nightmar on elm street and standard vampir fare in the form of a bad s music video this movi is jam full of bad act and an exhaust slow move stori although be such a bad and often laughabl movi dig those mullet and the terribl dialog it would be good materi to spoof on for an episod of mysteri scienc theater don t be fool by the proud mention of the film be the winner of the silver scroll award by the academi of sicenc fiction fanatasi and horror or that devo contribut to the soundtrack or that toni basil ha a part in the film it is a giant disast though one with a small cult follow see the other imdb comment for this film 
 
 
 
well after three time through i still have no idea what this movi is about becaus quit honest it fail to generat ani real interest or concern but here it goe a bunch of too old to be teen teen actor dress in horrifi latter s fashion did we look like that too decid it would be a realli good idea to get in a motorboat and go visit the abandon alcatraz after one of them ha nightmar of peopl be slaughter in various horrifi way that manag to rip off poltergeist the evil dead and freddi kreuger in one fell swoop the dimwit even envis himself be roast over an open fire with some deform freak slice off strip of tenderloin good thing it wa onli a dream or it might have hurt and good thing his dream had a decent special effect budget mine are usual pretti lame girl model space ship blow thing up with a bazooka etc onc on the alcatraz island they find themselv in a slasher movi and meet up with toni basil who cannot help but break into a coupl danc pose at time and had her own light crew complet with a smoke machin for that s smoki haze infus light look which i kind of miss and such remind me that m basil help choreograph david byrn of the talk head for some of his video and perform this of cours ha noth at all to do with the film but kept pop into mind a the movi pose veri littl to actual think about it sort of happen and you can either watch or keep work on your page markup with it on the tv set off to the side but sinc the film isn t realli interest you ll keep decid to finish one last thing instead of wast time the movi will keep end and you ll find yourself wonder what you miss everi time you realiz the end credit are start to roll again dammit some s teen horror movi can surviv such special view umberto lenzi s ghosthous chop mall it s killbot the hard to ignor night of the creep and the over the top sleepaway camp all come to mind they are film that like them or not demand your attent and usual pay off with some good gore or t a and typo in your work a evid that you were watch the tv instead of your keyboard i am sure that hell island a the british version i glom onto is titl doe inde have some good stuff in there but frank i don t care and noth is more annoy that encount art of ani genr that doesn t inspir admir some decent dislik or even good old honest hatr for it the film is content with simper away whatev minut of time and never realli accomplish anyth more than be a sometim distract in spite of my best effort to tri and give it a chanc but no dice there is some offbeat product design go on the use of light is strike at time and the occasion outburst of mayhem will probabl keep fan of s teen horror interest the rest of you be warn though you will wonder if you dress like that in and the answer is probabl more hideous than anyth which happen on screen tri to watch it a a free rental if possibl so that if disappoint you aren t stuck with the damn thing movi like this take up valuabl shelf space that is often at a commod these day what with the world come to an end all 
 
 
 
the summari provid by my cabl tv guid made it sound a lot more interest than it actual is slaughterhous rock is by far the worst horror film that i have ever seen a titl previous held by urban legend final cut from it open scene i could tell it s go to be realli bad but i wa so bore that i couldn t care le this film contain laughabl act especi by the guy who s torment in his dream incred a in not credibl plot twist and some of the crappiest music i ve heard and i m live in a period when the like of britney spear and nsync domin the air wave the biggest problem with slaughterhous rock is that it s not funni one would a film a dull and bore and so not scari a this would tri to spice thing up a bit with a few funni one liner here and there but no we have torment guy s self center friend tri to be funni but came across a annoy instead spoiler and plea do tell me who in this crazi world is insan and self loath enough to visit a creepi jail in the middl of the night no one if you re go to make a horror movi at least make it believ this one is anyth but 
 
 
 
i m gettin sick of movi that sound entertain in a one line synopsi then end up be equal to what you d find in the bottom center of a compost heap who know witcheri may have sound interest in a pitch to the studio even with a big name cast like blair and hasselhoff wink wink nudg nudg and the effervesc like of hildegard knef i dunno some woman but on film it just fall apart faster than a papier mach sculptur in a rainstorm seem these unfortun folk are trap in an island mansion off the eastern seaboard and one of them a woman i d guess is be target by a satan cult to bear the child of hell while the other are of in grotesqu tortuous way okay right there you have a cross section of plot from the exorcist the omen ten littl indian and a few other lesser movi in the satan worshipp run amok line none of it is veri entertain and for the most part you ll cring your way from scene to scene until it s over no not even linda blair and david hasselhoff help matter much they re just in it to pick up a paycheck and don t seem veri intent on give it their all from the look of it hasselhoff probabl wish he were back on the beack with pam anderson and who can blame him and linda well who know a celebr peta benefit or pro am golf tour or whatev it is she s in to nowaday and the tortur scene ecchhhh you ll see peopl get their mouth sewn shut dangl up insid roar fireplac strung up in tree dure a violent storm vessel burst out of their neck etc etc sheesh and i thought mark of the devil wa the most sadist movi i d seen don t bother it s not worth your time i can t believ i told you a much a i did if you do watch it just see if you can count the clich and yes blair get posse a if you didn t see that come down main street follow by a march band no star witcheri these witch will give you itch

this film is a pure failur i am a steve martin fan but even he can t save the tire idea and swiss chees script think polic academi and appli it to a militari parodi yuck i do not feel the other user comment reflect the poor rate this film receiv and right deserv it is extrem mislead i have often seen this film mark down to in the groceri store and now i certain know whi if onli i could get my minut back 
 
 
 
this wa a disappoint movi consid the materi armi life is alway good for a laugh and the star this movi should have been a fall down laughfest it wa worth a coupl of chuckl at best steve martin ha been much funnier than this and it appear that dan ackroyd should stick to dramat role where he might follow robin william lead and someday win an oscar

ok i m not an american but in my humbl scottish opinion steve martin is not never ha been and never will be a funni man a long a our posterior point in a souther direct phil silver a sergeant bilko wa a funni man no doubt due to the skill writer and director and all the other talent team work charact in the seri who contribut perfect to one of the funniest and dateless situat comedi america ha ever produc how anyon could have the audac to even attempt to replic the phil silver charact is beyond me to compound thing the exercis wa repeat in martin s unfunni attempt to be peter seller s inspector clouseau anoth abort attempt in my opinion to rekindl a demonstr unfunni career some of your contribut say steve martin put his own stamp on the charact to that i would say balderdash his portray will be long forgotten when those of silver and sellar will be treasur for generat to come
 
 
 
director jonathan lynn ha made some underr comedi in the past like greedi and clue this isn t one of them more akin to a polic academi film than it inspir it star steve martin in the old phil silver role a an armi sergeant forev pull scam under the nose of his superior but the idyl life of bilko and his lazi platoon look shaki when an old enemi visit the base determin to catch bilko in the act noth much happen realli it s all quit dull it s not veri funni martin dan aykroyd and phil hartman squeez a coupl of laugh out through sheer effort but they re all better than this and it s quit pain watch them work with such thin materi

a previous review said the movi is not all that bad what the movi glorifi child molest oh but sylvia kristel wa nake in it so let s give it out of star whi not a full becaus the filmographi wa agon the child s look of shock were unrealist and the fat friend wa irrit nowher in the review doe the review express ani outrag that an american movi in featur scene of a child have sex with a grown woman i happen to catch this steam loaf of a movi while stay at a hotel that had showtim to me even if the fat friend had act up a storm and wa a deserv of an oscar i would still have to give the movi onli star that tv s howard hessman star in the movi at the same time a he wa appear in wkrp is particular ridicul but don t take my word for it 
 
 
 
it is obvious illeg pedophil pray on stuff like this how did they get away with make such a movi this movi is all sum up in one word sick where do peopl get off make and watch these kind of film a i wa watch the movi i didn t actual think they would allow this kid that is say mayb if that actual sleep with this woman sorri if this is a spoiler to you but i would have rater not seen this where ha the saniti of these peopl gone mayb the maker of this movi are pedophil our societi today is fill with all type of sexual predat that pray upon child yet film maker make these type of movi that do noth but provok this type of behavior i notic that on a previous comment someon ask if there wa a version where it show them nake this is a kid here and someon is ask someth like this what is wrong with this pictur 
 
 
 
one of the those come of age film that should have nostalgia for adult and promis for the kid this movi ha neither it is a poor excus to let sylvia kristel s bodi doubl frolic with a dorki eric brown to make matter wors the movi is either silli or stupid when it tri to be funni sexi or dramat laugh awkward a we are suppos to believ that a teenag would go alon with buri a dead woman in his front yard ponder vigor on whi a woman famous for emmanuell need a bodi doubl a the movi went on and on i start to imagin a hybrid of privat lesson and littl miss million that had sylvia kristel seduc jennif love hewitt a howard hesseman make u nostalg for wkrp watch this to laugh at other peopl s stupid or for ed begley jr s commit perform or to wonder what sylvia kristel would look like with jennif love hewitt but i can give you an idea of your lesson stay away from movi stare sylvia kristel that are not emmanuell 
 
 
 
the film look super on paper a romant comedi in which a frantic lover get drag into a smuggl thriller should be generic cross breed gold especi with this excel romcom cast i m afraid lawrenc kasdan simpli give his two star too much rope though and they duli go and hang themselv adam brook script may well be to blame but you d expect better from the kevin kline of a fish call wanda instead the two ping pong off one anoth and the unlik burgeon romanc is never reconcil satisfactorili with the reason either of them are in and dash around franc jean reno co star amiabl a the cop with a heart and i guess wish he wa a star with a part mind you he went on to do those pink panther remak s so perhap he wa ok with this 
 
 
 
were i not with friend and so cheap i would have walk out it fail miser a satir and didn t even have the redempt of camp 
 
 
 
this comedi ha some toler funni stuff in it surround by a lot of unfunni stuff just about everi scene involv the servant of the castl and their silli antic is a wast of time and the plot is so sloppi that it make you wonder if they actual had a script readi befor they start film this or they were simpli make it all up a they went along 
 
 
 
oh brother the onli reason this veri irrit film avoid get the total bomb from me is becaus it s at least histor noteworthi a the first three stoog film when they weren t yet on their own and were still saddl with that pain unfunni ted heali but even a a longtim stoog fan i d have to say that young moe larri and cur are bad use here a three zani assist janitor to mr heali s taller bos janitor they re not featur steadili through the movi and their silli on and off again stint paint them more like zani overact cartoon charact tri too hard to be amus most of this toothach deal with jack pearl seek in vain to get some chuckl from the audienc himself a a man who imperson baron munchausen here s a good exampl of the level of humor i object on what ground coffe ground his sidekick is none other than a young jimmi durant but even the schnoz himself is a bore 
 
 
 
strain comedi a sketch like revu which wa initi a vehicl to showcas one time radio star jack pearl but is now best rememb a america s introduct to the three stoog actual larri cur and moe are bill alongsid comic ted heali a ted heali and his three stoog although the support cast featur jimmi durant who is complet wast on dim materi and zasu pitt the onli audienc for the film these day are stoog addict and even they won t find much to applaud here incred loud and overbear it show how far hollywood had to go to reach a certain level of slapstick sophist from 
 
 
 
this film s basic premis is a polit cartoon i suppos for those who know noth about the realiti of the militari this is probabl a feel good film on gender equal inde a recent comment state it let woman know that they can do anyth they want to do what claptrap no one man or woman can do anyth they want to do and unfortun demi moor buf up for seal hell week in the earli week bud s program by a few session at the local gym and her desir alon to be a seal is simpli not go to make it so there is approxim an dropout rate in what is arguabl the roughest militari train program those are the one who voluntarili drop out can t compet on a physic level suffer frequent physic injuri dure the train or can t handl the psycholog harass i never got beyond the shallow of the contriv purport messag of this film in the real world demi wouldn t last the first hour in this harsh and sustain physic train wish alon won t do it skip this film a wish think and better spend your time read the warrior elit by dick couch crown new york for the best descript a to what realli goe on in this train ring the bell demi 
 
 
 
this is easili the worst ridley scott film ridley scott is a wonder director but this film is a black mark on his career demi moor and viggo mortensen both total miscast in an overaggress film about a girl go to the armi veri stupid and there is never one scene that is convinc in ani way it is realli not difficult to make a film such a this everyth the crew make could have been an idea of just anybodi the writer didn t have much inspir either mani foolish dialog that made no sen at all and some brainless action i strong recommend to stay away from this rubbish i hope that the mani talent person involv in this project realiz this type of film doe not deserv their attent and that in the futur they will work on more honor and more intellig movi than this useless mess 
 
 
 
hmmm where to start how doe a serious actress like demi moor got involv in such crap first blood might be rate a bull t but this type of nonsens is just rambo with tit point of cours if you are interest in the crapstori demi moor just want to prove that a woman can be part of the navi seal that is the most stupid clich one i can think of you ll say gi jane is a great movi just the perform from viggo mortensen made this movi bearabl but hell i can t think of demi moor be rambo especi not dure the last useless minut ridley scott doesn t deserv the credit to make this movi one that come up for woman with equal right it s just brainless propaganda for the american armi and to make it more attract they drop moor in it aw movi 
 
 
 
natur i didn t watch gi jane out of choic i wa more or le forc to watch this film round my ex girlfriend hous gi jane lose it credibl straight away by tri to convinc the viewer that it is potenti a real scenario which of cours it isn t the result of this is that the stori becom automat bound by constraint restrict the amount of humour of which there is none or entertain action scene and soon becom too serious the film therefor becom extrem bore and predict gi jane fail where other action film succeed main becaus film such a jame bond dirti harri and various other are larger than life yet never proclaim to be otherwis they are escap and therefor entertain gi jane tri to be real and fail this is a veri disappoint film from ridley scott with a veri non credibl storylin unremark act and the onli reason i give it instead of is for some of the technic work 
 
 
 
after read through mani of the review i don t know what movi some peopl were watch but clear it wasn t the same one i saw this movi is horribl the act primarili moor s is just terribl the woman cannot act nice tit but she just can t act at no point did she come across a the actual charact instead it wa spoil hollywood actress goe to the beach to play make believ with the boy and that s what this movi ultim is hollywood make believ the train sequenc are over the top the polit over the top the polit correct over the top the combat scene you guess it over the top your mission is to get in and get out without be detect so what do you do whi shoot off a mani round and make a much nois a possibl of cours oh g i jane you can be my wing man anytim the premis is good but a soon a hollywood get a hold of it we end up with top gun with tit what more is to be expect from commerci u film anymor not much i guess 
 
 
 
watch this movi wa a wast of time i wa tempt to leav in the middl of the movi but i resist i don t know what ridley scott intend but i learn that in the armi woman get a stupid a men they learn to spit to insult and to fight in combat and that s also a wast of time in my opinion and anyway what the hell wa that final scene in lybia are they still fight gadafi or is it that it s easi for everyon to believ islam peopl are alway a danger 
 
 
 
i ll be short and to the point this movi wa an insult to ani one with a room temperatur iq sorri liber feminist etc no woman will ever be a seal they can forget about the draft or be in combat too ain t go to happen you see hard a it is to understand or accept men and woman are physic differ regardless of the fact it is realiti cannot chang thing in order for peopl to avoid have their feel hurt men can t give birth or breast feed babi oh i forgot about san franfreako woman lack the physic strength to be on par with men in a combat or other physic challeng situat how mani woman play in the nfl or nhl last i couldn t give a bloodi hoot in hell if what i just wrote upset you come to think of it if this doe upset you that onli warm my heart more i didn t write one thing that wasn t the truth this imbecil movi is noth more than a comedi and a lousi one at that 
 
 
 
demi moor s charact in the movi wa select for the seal becaus of her look that wa a bad start and the movi went down from there the plot wa total unbeliev the will to make it in a tough militari unit is not enough this movi did not convinc me of a woman s physic abil to perform the type of task requir tri to pretend that woman and men are basic the same is an insult to everyon s intellig the differ between the sex are what make life interest 
 
 
 
whi would a person go back to a person who kick them in the teeth not onc not twice but over and over again this film teach u that in order to find love we must accept abus not just forgiv it but fulli accept it gosh no wonder my first relationship onli last ten year i obvious wasn t embrac my inner masochist a bucatinski s write debut there are mani wonder aspect to this film howev in order to justifi the reunion of eli and tom more charact develop would have been help we are never acquaint with eli s masoch in fact we are led to believ that he is not a masochist although tom s psycho emot sadism is high evid 
 
 
 
i think this piec of garbag is the best proof that good idea can be destroy whi all the american anim think that the kid this day want stupid gi joe version of good stori the looney tune are some of the most belov charact in histori but they weren t creat to be xtreme i mean come on tini toon wa a great exampl of how an old idea can be updat without loo it s origin charm but this piec of garbag is just an exampl of stupid corpor decis that onli want to creat a cheap idiot show that kid will love becaus hey kid love superhero right the whole show is onli a wast of time in which we see the new version of the looney tune but this time in superhero form this doesn t sound too bad but the problem is that this show tri too hard to copi seri like batman the anim seri or the new justic leagu the result bad copi of flash the road runner or superman who el bug bunni the problem is that looney tune weren t meant to be dramat the were suppos to be funni a i said befor this seri suck and mani peopl wonder whi anim is take all over the world this show tri to be dramat and action pack but that s someth that few seri and anim are abl to do if you want to see a good upgrad of an old show watch tini toon that s an exampl that it s possibl to bring back to life old charact but with a good stori and respect the origin root too bad that show is alreadi dead anoth corpor wise decis i suppos 
 
 
 
 well chuck jone is dead let soil his charact by ad cheap explos an american drawn anim knock off style and give them superpow but sir don t we all readi have sever show in the work that are alreadi like this much le don t dump all over their origin creator dream yes and those show make u a bunch of cash and we need more but won t everi man woman and child who grew up with these time le charact be annoy hay you re right set it in the futur make them all descend s of the origin charact and chang all the name slight but not too much though we still need to be abl to milk the success of the classic well that s the onli reason i can think of whi this even exist if you look past the horribl desecr of our belov looney toon then it look like an ok show but then there is alreadi the teen titan s which is the same bloodi thing all the charact are dress like batman they drive around in some sort of ship fight super villain they have superpow onli differ is they sort of talk like the looney tune and have similar name and charact trait this kind of thing fall into the it s so ridicul it s good kind of categori think of the super mario brother s movi and batman and robin if you want to laugh for all the wrong reason check this out if you are of the younger generat what this thing is actual intend for and can look pas the greedi execut shameless then run with it and enjoy if you enjoy this cartoon i don t have a problem with you it s the peopl who calcul this thing togeth that i am mad at you know how they say piraci is like steal a car this show is like grave rob they might a well of dug up all the peopl involv with the origin cartoon shove them on a display dress them up in err pirat costum and charg money if this show wasn t use charact one that didn t resembl the looney toon in anyway whatsoev that have alreadi made the studio million then this would be fine but no for shame warner brother for shame if i saw this thing a a second gag on an episod of the simpson s or famili guy i would love it a it is i just can t believ this wa ever made i would bet anyon that of the peopl who work on this show hate it but whatev it doesn t realli matter in year this show will have been forgotten while the origin will live on forev or at least until the world end come snoopi and the peanut gang are back and now they have freak laser and can turn invis can charley brown defeat the evil alien warlord zapar tune in and see 
 
 
 
they probabl should have call this movi the map becaus the major of the whole stupid film is revolv around a map of a cemeteri not to mention how mani of the same bore shot of the map there are the onli thing they show more than the map itself is the littl bead of sweat that is constant build up on the forehead of our main charact this of cours wa the film maker way of show u how incred ten thing are get up on the immort hill cemeteri come on now couldn t they have shown u just one of the death scene we hear a whole lot about how everyon who is list on the map is drop like fli but we don t get to see anyth some how i buri the live mang to keep my attent so i wa fair generous with the rate i gave it but i will not recommend this movi to anyon unless you have a deep fascin with map or sweat i recommend rent a better i movi such a i spit on your grave or i drink your blood 
 
 
 
this movi could have been great caus it got a somewhat fascin premis but it never rise abov sheer caricatur the act is sever flaw and there were moment where i cring so sever that i thought i wa go to fall of my seat in the theater never and i mean never watch this godawful piec of danish cinema ha been get a lot of good pr the recent year but if this piec of cross the border i m afraid nobodi sane will ever want to rent a danish movi this movi is the reason whi i chose to regist here i realli felt i need to steer peopl away from this piec of my sympathi go out to the peopl who alreadi went to the cinema to watch this
 
 
 
the good thing about this that s at least fresh almost no movi about danc music and the club scene if even made hit the cinema and it radiat lot of energi too from the music to the portray of ibiza but the main problem is that it can t decid what it want to be although it definit like to be a mockumentari in the line of this is spinal tap the maker also realiz they wouldn t want to play copycat howev it fail grossli on the joke becaus it s not veri well written and most charact are underdevelop and it ha no arc in it script and direct to make it to minut so whi not edit it down to the product depart and cinematographi still tri to save the day e g paul s home in a strang way and unexpect so it s all gone pete tong work much better a a simpl drama in the line of almost famous especi the scene with beatriz batarda offer some act power conclus it s a mess it somewhat entertain at a basic level but you better spend a night in your favorit club 
 
 
 
creepi lascivi wolf the young red is wear full make up and extrem short short robe got about minut through and realiz it could be a pedophil s dream come true the up beat music sound a lot like someth i d hear at a strip club i actual think this movi is a sick joke it s not a famili movi gross glad i wa watch this with my daughter i don t want her to think it s normal for famili to view quasi kiddi porn togeth veri bad veri sad it s sold a a famili film joey faton will probabl be embarrass he wa in it and what s with advertis it a a special effect spectacular the effect do look low budget gawd aw 
 
 
 
reli on the posit review abov we saw a free screen of this last night now i know that filmmak plant posit review becaus there is no way an object individu could have written these destin to becom a cult classic the theater wa pack appar with friend and famili of the product crew becaus onli a few of u walk out by the first hour the song were the most liter i ve ever heard in a music don t take the short cut honey there s a wolf in the wood debi mazar s eye blink furious a she struggl to sing fortun most of the tune last for onli a few line now whoever play the wolf in this tale should be charm and seduct instead we get joey faton ex n syncer live up to his last name a he s not age well he s not exact lith with his extra pound and junior high school qualiti makeup and out of tune sing serious this guy wa in vocal group the rest of the actor are semi adequ but can t do much about the unimagin script you know it is possibl to write for adult and child at the same time see under pixar on the posit side the virtual set look nice and were well integr with the actor and it wasn t a offens a crash 
 
 
 
the creativ of this movi wa lost from the begin when the writer and director left out a good stori line onli to substitut with horribl special affect this movi seem to be focus on amus child but couldn t even accomplish that mani small low budget film have the potenti to becom great movi but this movi is no where near that fortun this will be anoth film easili made and easili forgotten this movi wa probabl a chanc for the actor to make a littl money on the side until their chanc came along for a real role in a good movi anyon who ha a shred of respect for film should avoid see this movi at all cost

i m not go to say that this movi is horribl becaus i have seen wors but it s not even halfway decent the plot is veri confus i couldn t realli figur out what wa happen and where thing were go when the movi wa over i wa left scratch my head i watch through to the end of the credit to see if they had someth after them that may clear thing up but onc the credit were over that wa it i felt like i wa jar from one weak plot point to anoth throughout the whole movi with littl or no transit between the two charact develop is veri shallow i couldn t figur out when somebodi wa angri or had a grudg against someon i couldn t tell if half of the charact were just suppos to be drunk stone mental challeng or they just had a bad actor to portray them this film seem to be base around stereotyp to it s credit they are hard to avoid use when you are make a film about a singer in a rock band which should make charact develop easier sinc so mani other film have alreadi illustr the suffer of an abus child or the trial of a heroin addict tri to come clean stereotyp are easi to depict which would explain whi so mani bad film tend to overus stereotyp charact this film on the other hand use stereotyp charact left and right but then tri to keep them a incomprehens a possibl anoth problem with the charact is that they seem to be dismiss with no explan i guess that s ok becaus so littl time wa spent develop the charact that i realli didn t get a chanc to know ani of them so i never realli miss ani of them and last but not least wa sadi s sing it s aw the music back her up is not prize winner but it is usual drown out by the screech that are releas from sadi s vocal cord i swear that there s one point in the movi where she sing a song for at least minut i serious thought i wa go to have to turn it off dure this howl a thon a a whole this movi is confus charact are ill develop georgia s act is wooden and stiff sadi s charact is yank from one bad situat to anoth with no back stori or explan the music wa unbear and i can think of no good reason to see this film unless you have a thirst for cinemat pain 
 
 
 
ani film which begin with a cowhand shag a femal calf can t promis much a for the stereotyp of the kibbutz a it wa yr ago well i wa there and it just wasn t like that ok everi kibbutz had just a small piec of someth shown in the film like youngster raid the kitchen at night but you can t show the whole kibbutz a be full of all those shall we say naughti trait each kibbutz had it own problem but hard ani kibbutz had all of them the view of israel were great i still rememb my youth in that garden of eden call the emek valley yes and the act wa good too so you see it wasn t all black just a wrong portray probabl on purpos too 
 
 
 
i saw this movi just now not when it wa releas and hail a best pictur of the year here in israel and to summar everyth right now i will just say this is not a good film this is dror shaul s second featur film and i have to admit that his first and the tv drama he made befor this pictur are much better further more this is his first attempt at direct a drama the earli work were comedi and were funni and effect the first thing you have to know if you ll ever see this film israel of the st centuri hate the kibbutz and the valu it repres sinc the format of the state of israel the real situat of the kibbutz is veri dire and some of them disappear one by one the kibbutz hebrew word for collect wa a sort of villag for member onli where the valu of equal and social were the dogma for everyday life with the chang in social valu with time it seem now that the kibbutz wa a place where the human spirit wa repress lock within the dogma rule with no ticket out the entranc of capitalist valu and way of life in the s and so far made it veri hard on the kibbutz to surviv the crazi mother in the film is the central metaphor for that but i regard this film a have noth to do with nostalgia for the good old day of the kibbutz onc it wa a dream of everi young coupl to live in a kibbutz and rais child in this quit and beauti environ but the film show the opposit that the kibbutz with it s socialist dogma wa a place sort of like a cult of crazi peopl with crazi idea that undermin the freedom of each individu within the collect this is the central philosophi of post modern capit your individu is the most import thing you must place yourself in the center and no one el but you is the matter this is the philosophi the film stand for and that s just it s first sin if you disagre with me on the polit side i m sure you will agre that the act the tone of the film it s script and it s direct are the four sin that follow the film ha no real visual text and none of it s shot is someth to rememb it is also veri delic a delicaci that is no more than artsi fartsi attempt to provok emot which do not surfac not in the film and not with the viewer it bring noth but boredom can someon plea explain whi this film won so mani prize mayb becaus it show that israel is in line with the rest of the world hate socialist and human valu or mayb it show that israel is a delic place not give in to dogma and fanatic that we are basic veri human and good peopl capabl of emot especi when they are fake one just like capit expect u to be or mayb becaus it tell one of the biggest lie of isra cinema in recent year a lie that undermin the justif of the exist of the jewish state no matter what the answer is it s not a good one not for the world not for human valu and not for the jew

home alon is one of my least favourit movi it s the cream of the crop or s if you tend to be more cynic a it rank up or down there with stuff like battlefield earth and flinston viva rock vega in fact it could even be wors than those two sinc those two at least intermitt made me laugh at their stupid this just made me cring in pain constant and clap when the credit start roll no other movi ha made me cring in pain now i will point out exact whi this movi is so incred atroci first off the plot is ridicul it revolv around a chip in a remot control car that is misplac and how these terrorist want it dumb stuff the action that ensu is similar to that of the other two home alon with boobytrap and all but watch these boobytrap be execut is rather than be funni incred unpleas to watch i didn t laugh or even so much a smile onc rather i cring constant and hope that the terrorist would nail the kid the bird rather than provid comic relief wa unfunni and annoy the act a done by a bunch of no name rang from poor to atroci there is not a singl good perform here alex d linz is absolut unlik and unfunni a the kid while the terrorist act and judg by their movi credit look a they ve been hastili pick off the street and well that s it i can see some peopl say man it s for the kid don t dis it man well man kid may like this but they can get a hell of a lot better see monster inc and toy stori befor even consid get this out hell even scoobi doo and garfield which suck see those review for more are better than this so in short this is an irredeem atroci movi this wa clear recycl for the money a it almost complet rip off the first two the onli thing is it complet insult the first two a well no human kid or otherwis should find ani reason to see home alon ever it s that bad stars
 
 
 
this is the worst ripoff of home alon movi that i have ever seen watch part and two but don t let anyon say that this is better than the first two i mean realli you don t make a movi then make a sequel with the same charact and actor and then make anoth sequel with differ charact and actor i mean it would have been ok if this wan t a home alon movi but they did make it a home alon movi culkin is too old now so you re suppos to stop make sequel good this movi make me sick buy part and 
 
 
 
the first home alon wa a decent enough film the sequel wa pretti much the same at a new set this one tri to be origin and succeed to some degre of cours the formula is basic the same so it s like watch the same movi for a third time with slight alter plot the new score is quit bad though the new set trap piec wa if noth el interest and differ especi compar to the grand score of the first and the almost but not quit a good score of the second it almost make up for it by use some pretti good non origin music but it s just not the same the plot is fair and somewhat origin to the franchis but it s still basic the same movi a the first two with wors act and a le impress exampl of the scari charact turn out to be good the act is most unimpress the charact are most caricatur the new thiev are le entertain than the old one and they make fun of spi stuff which is almost crimin given the limit amount of good spi flick there are and how precious few of them are cool the fact that there are more of them and therebi more trap is just a weak attempt at tri to go one higher than the first two film and it doesn t work the idea behind the thiev and their mission is a tad too adult and serious for a child s film and there wa a sexual joke or two though that isn t the first time in the seri it s also unnecessarili complex a is the plot in general i could follow it but i doubt a kid could some of the exposit are deliv so obvious that even child may find it stupid the anim stuff is general not amus there are fewer sibl which should mean that those there are get develop more but they have le person than the least featur of those of the first two film all in all just not particular good or worth watch unless you realli love watch crimin get hurt in cartoon y violenc i recommend this to huge fan of the seri onli 
 
 
 
this is the worst brain damag ultra cheap super stupid silli pointless piec of trash i ve ever seen an unbeliev garbag of instant cult status among fan of the bizarr if you think that ed wood s plan is bad well let me tell you look like citizen kane compar to that one special effect again plan is star war act thor johnson is al pacino so it s beyond bad realli but if you are look for that kind of incred movi it s for you i m a fan of american intern for so mani glorious horror movi the price corman poe saga and some great blaxploit stuff but with star creatur they descend right down to the z level of cours my out of work in revers if you like to watch bad movi for fun the guy play an indian chief is great so have fun and enjoy if you can

 let me start by say that i understand that invas of the star creatur wa meant to be a parodi of the sci fi film of the s i understand that none of it is to be taken serious the problem i have is that none of it work a parodi should be funni and this one just isn t not onc dure the entir runtim did i so much a crack a smile in general i am easili entertain but i couldn t find a sliver of entertain anywher in invas of the star creatur i knew i wa in troubl right from the begin the two star make their screen appear with one of the lamest gag imagin a water hose they can t control that get them both wet these two come off a boweri boy wannab whi anyon would want to mime the act and persona of the boweri boy is beyond me after the le than illustri begin the movi goe on to featur comic chase sequenc danc indian veget men decod ring and other assort unfunni bit it s all just a complet wast of time i bought this on the doubl featur dvd with invas of the bee girl that movi is academi award win stuff in comparison with invas of the star creatur 
 
 
 
gloria victor and dolor reed in space girl costum i love sci fi i even love cheesi s sci fi but this film is realli realli bad and not in a mst k kinda way virtual unwatch a a coupl of bozo do their best hip cat impress of abott costello chessecak can usual save cheesi sci fi such a in cat woman on the moon but it can t in this case this film requir a mute button and fast forward featur that said i could watch gloria and dolor walk around the space ship for about an hour or so 
 
 
 
this wa one of those film that got a ton of play on the airwav in the earli s usual on the am movi or one time on the pm channel big movi and still anoth on creatur doubl featur when local channel use to run movi a part of their local program most gone today in favor of infomerci time it wa of the time a coupl of low rent abbott and costello wannabe franki ray and robert ball are in a platoon of soldier half a dozen guy in armi surplus remaind who are sent on field maneuv to look into some strang radiat and wind up encount extraterrestri they first go into bronson canyon to what would be later the famous batcav on batman and encount the remain of a dead carrot monster later in the cave they re chase by a live carrot creatur basic a guy in black suit and paper mach head with spark thing on it and ping pong ball eye two of them complet geek ray and ball are captur and wake up tie to tabl and are be examin by space amazon dr poona nooo kid and professor tanga who are stun beauti and even moreso in their skimpi bikini uniform we were too young at the time to realiz what later bondag and fetish scenario this examin scene would more than suggest turn out that the two gal and their carrot monster are strand on earth with a ship that s well hidden and are tri to return to their world the film wa made a a total comedi with vari degre of tast but rememb this wa of the time when eric von zipper and his crew from franki and annett s film were the height of b film drive in comedi so it onli seem a natur to jump on the bandwagon for some quick buck for some reason i onli thought i d imagin see this film to start with no i realli saw it and when it wa releas on restor dvd i wa assur in my memori the comedi goe from mild funni to just plain stupid but whatev the budget is non exist which is a minor miracl when you think about it that it even got made and we can talk about a restor version here and now over year later the payoff is the girl who want to learn about love and kiss and the upshot is the geek which all of u were get the girl and love win out it s just goofi and silli and for the locat ha nostalg signific 
 
 
 
i appreci a think posit feel good about yourself film but this is too much in the end they look like a bunch of looni this film is one of those find yourself s plot i know the film is made in a lot more of clint and girl friend movi this movi is a 
 
 
 
this is a bit of a first for me the first time i have ever been disappoint in a tim burton film pota isn t a bad film great set costum and the odd great perform but it could have been made by ani off the shelf hollywood director the pace wa veri odd the last third wa just spent wait for the film to end by myself and the cast tim roth wa excel probabl the onli pleasur in the film come back tim 
 
 
 
ten minut worth of stori stretch out into the better part of two hour when noth of ani signific had happen at the halfway point i should have left but ever hope i stay and left with a feel of guilt for have wast the time act wa ok but the stori line is so transpar and weak the script is about a lame a it could get but again stretch out the ten minut plot doesn t leav a whole lot of room for good dialogu 
 
 
 
i had alway been a big lynda carter wonder woman fan so when the sci fi channel ran this movi i had to see it i wa bitter disappoint this is a wonder woman movi in name onli she doesn t wear the right costum [she must have refus to or had order major changes] and the plot run like a poor man s jame bond there s none of the thing that made the comic book heroin a success i e the superhuman strength or determin will it s just one long bad dream i don t even think cathi is all that attract anyway i wouldn t wast your time on this 
 
 
 
i ve been read post here concern wonder woman s costum for this tv movi it should be point out at the time the movi wa made she wasn t wear her tradit outfit the produc were actual stick to the comic book writer s concept of ww for the earli seventi a for the movi itself i have to agre with mani of the other poster here snoozefest i wa a kid when it appear on abc in so i wa at the right age to have appreci a movi about a comic book hero yet i wa so engross with the plot i stop watch it three quarter into the movi of cours i wasn t at the right age to appreci cathi lee 
 
 
 
it seem that salvator couldn t decid what to do with this movi some of it is a veri weak thriller and i say veri veri weak some of it is an attempt to explor the relationship between the main charact both thing have been tri in psycholog thriller but in this case the movi cannot hold thing togeth due to poor superfici script bad act and a too dark too dull cinematographi i d say that salvator gave his best in other genr and in other set where he wa free to look at the charact without have to think about the plot on the whole a b movi hard worth your money vote 
 
 
 
consid how much money wa budget for this film you would expect more from the stori a a whole this could be quit possibl the most worthless movi i have ever watch there wa no real advanc of anyth charact develop minim plot advanc mayb enjoy none i m not sure what point were even tri to be made if you want to see a movi where terrorist are kinda good guy american cia bomb everyth that doesn t agre with our opinion all capitalist are corrupt and you like to see anyth resembl a storyboard advanc accompani by a death have at for those of u who realiz that it doesn t take kill off a good guy to make a point we ll stick to other movi in summari this wa a horribl attempt at an ocean s style hide the plot so person ha to think movi becaus not onli do you not know what s go on nobodi who made the movi did either home alon wa a better cinemat piec 
 
 
 
absolut the worst film yet by burton who seem to be get wors with each film he direct a miser script load with clich is onli the first of mani objection aspect to this film this is the kind of movi where everi time someth happen you ll be sure to hear someon shout out he s lost his gun or whatev it is to let everybodi know carter is realli aw and so is wahlberg who can t play this straight and be convinc veri nice effect and photographi but poor music in the john william mold by burton s croni elfman heston appear in a nonsensich scene to spout out his most famous catch phrase from the first movi veri poor result if anyon el out there also saw sleepi hollow they will probabl have notic a i have the declin qualiti of burton s film i ve heard that this particular project wa produc by other and that burton wa brought in a director in which case his judgement should be question but i think he ha allow ani possibl vision he might have had earlier in his career to slip the evid is there in the film in sleepi hollow he couldn t decid what kind of movi he wa make whether it wa a comedi or a real horror movi and the popul of british charact actor chris lee etc made you also think it wa kind of a monster ralli film those are never scari a horror fan know the movi couldn t succeed on either horror or comedi becaus it wa so schizophren and no style had been develop to smooth the two togeth planet of the ape is much the same way and the result come off more like total recal or tango and cash than like sci fi he s also fallen into the rut of so mani other big director of tri to satisfi the entir possibl audienc word to burton if you re out there pick someth and do it straight or use some style to peic it all togeth a in mar attack or beetlejuic or you might a well retir becaus peopl like me that are fan of your movi will stop go

i had to give this film a becaus it s that bad but don t make this think that i didn t enjoy watch becaus i laugh and laugh and i even had a few question so half of the time i wa laugh half of the time i wa say what in the hell is go on or whi would someon do this et cetera i most enjoy the terribl fog effect the s style nude scene battl dialogu nude scene and the way that the warrior s sword flap in the wind when they ride their hors and there s some crappi model effect those aren t suppos to be real tree are they and i still don t understand this guy that they find in the cave what in the hell is he a friend of mine told me about these movi and i thought i would give em a tri and i basic like the film a peopl like ed wood film i have no real enjoy of what the film wa meant to be i look at it in my own hilari way so don t let this distract you if you realli thought this wa an action movi it is i just like it for other reason it s much much wors than evil dead so it can actual make you think a though you are wast your life by watch it which came into my mind a few time i guess the best thing for most peopl would be to have a few drink have some friend around and laugh at this film mayb this is a bit harsh but i don t think so rent it and you ll see yo 
 
 
 
 or more precis so bad that you are go to have the time of your life laugh your as off when you watch it jame sbardellati s deathstalk of is certain one of the most aw product the sword sorceri sub genr ha brought along but it is high amus the act is terribl the plot is pure crap and the effect and photographi couldn t be more amateurish but it is the bad act the cheesi effect and the mani error that make this movi so hilari spoiler ahead deathstalk rick hill is an extrem strong and skill warrior one day a good witch task him to unit the three power of chao and creation a sword an amulet and a chalic in order to free the countri from it brutal ruler the evil king and sorcer munkar obtain the sword is quit easi but the amulet and the chalic are in munkar s posse fortun the evil king ha arrang a tournament in which the counti s most skill warrior fight each other until death the winner is then to take the king s place of cours the king doesn t want anybodi to take his place an therefor he ha plan to kill the winner instead of just not arrang the tournament in the first place deathstalk is not onli to obtain the the three power of creation but also to save the old good king s gorgeous daughter barbi benton from the claw of evil munkar luckili he doesn t get bore on his way to the tournament sinc he is allow hump the gorgeous femal warrior kaira lana clarkson in the meantim the film ha mani great incred stupid and funni scene some of my favorit scene includ deathstalk behead a bad guy with his sword the head that fall down howev is not that guy s head the fall head ha a red goate while the guy behead by deathstalk had dark hair and no beard when the charact of femal warrior kaira lana clarkson is introduc she is first seen in a black robe hide her face and bodi deathstalk s travel companion oghri richard brooker fight her and dure the sword fight her robe under which she is of cours topless open expo her breast her breast are the first thing we see of lana clarkson even befor her face the last warrior deathstalk ha to fight in the tournament is a giant guy with the bodi of a man and the head of a pig evil munkar ha an ugli littl creatur lock in a chest he feed that littl creatur human eyebal and finger there are mani other unintent funni hilari and great scene the act is terribl but barbi benton and the late lana clarkson are eye candi and although i describ this movi a unintent funni i sometim had the impress that some of the actor were absolut awar of how crappi the movi is there is a fair amount of gore and lot of femal nuditi to keep the viewer entertain deathstalk is an incred aw movi but i still high recommend it peopl with a sen of humor will have the time of their live 
 
 
 
deathstalk is direct by john watson and it star rick hill who is some kind of bodi builder and famous of that if i have understood right the plot follow a deathstalk hill tri to get someth back from the evil lord and he ha to travel to the lord s cave he meet mani dwarf and monster dure his journey and the set are veri close to tolkien and of cours conan the barbarian this is a rip off of huge success of conan and even though this is veri stupid film it ha mani nice trash merit and is recommend for trash fan and toler film junki there are no mani cinemat merit in this film coupl of scene are almost atmospher and fascin but what deathstalk concentr to show are nude femal and huge muscl of hill femal are usual helpless victim and veri stupid too so this is veri macho film and thus may not plea mani feminist the fight scene are noth special and pretti dull and the monster are not either anyth special and all the other aspect of the film are also veri amateurish and bad done but what did you expect from low budget effort like this this tri to be a great a conan but fail pretti miser a i said this can plea fan of turkey cinema but no one el this belong to the categori it s so bad it s great deathstalk is still not a near a bad a it could be and a a turkey film i appreci this almost a much a other turkey enjoy one of cours if bad film are your cup of tea then tri this and have fun but if you don t understand enjoy bad film then stay away and if somebodi can t stand larg amount of nuditi then stay away a well there is more nuditi here than violenc and due to these scene the film ha an r rate otherwis this could be some safe pg famili film 
 
 
 
this film s kind of like conan the barabarian but with more sex rape and murder there is a plot somewher underneath all this debaucheri but the filmmak don t do a good job show it which is a shame becaus it could be a decent stori richard hill give a solid perform in the lead role a doe the villain who sad didn t appear in anyth el of note the fight scene aren t too bad either i love the way deathstalk let his sword drink the blood of his victim and there s plenti of nuditi and sex to temper the general level of machismo throughout all in all not good but not necessarili that bad either 
 
 
 
woosh man what can i say the open scene mayb we see a bunch of mongoloid barbarian with bad make up jump off the wall of some ruin they sneak around and attack some dude with a scantili cloth captiv girl the dude run off the mongoloid follow him and one of them stay behind seem to rape the girl but instead he expo one of her breast and kidnap her then the dude still on the run see a hors and tri to steal it sudden a blond god like look hero with a bad wig appear say that s my hors the mighti deathstalk just made his appear the mongoloid arriv deathstalk kill all of them includ the dude on the tune of some rather inappropri mexicano western score this is suppos to be a sword sorceri flick so what s with the arriba trompetto and then goe up to captiv girl and expo both her breast he start to rub them and captiv girl seem to like it she start like her lip and caress deathstalk just when they are about to get down to it this old dude appear interrupt what could have been the end of a perfect day for deathstalk and a possibl perfect end for a short film now tell me isn t that the point where either a feminist would angrili switch off the movi or ani other male viewer would say this is go to be one hell of a good movi the plot is a simpl a throw a kitten from the balconi deathstalk must obtain the sword of justic and use it to steal the amulet of life and the chalic of magic from the evil sorcer munkar asid from decapit dismember random bloodsh retard fist fight and embarrass sword fight this film also contain a massiv amount of t t a shot i initi want to add one extra point to this movi for each gratuit shot of nake boobi i could count after point not even halfway into the movi i had to give up count it wa distract me from the rest of the movi and the rest of the movi wa worth it total crazi stuff check out this mutant cat worm like creatur munkar ha a a pet and which he feed eyebal and finger and here s an interest question what would you do if a man in a woman s bodi would enter your bedroom and tri to kill you with a knife the answer is simpl you slap him around a bit take away the knife and then tri to rape him then you discov that he s actual not a woman so you throw him out of your bed and tell him to leav your room it work out well i tell you deathstalk doe it too and the deathstalk way is the right way deathstalk is a wonder movi realli a point out in other comment the villain are vile the woman are delici there s blood sex violenc rape and tasti chicken there s a complet pointless tournament which just featur a bunch of barbarian beat slash and hack the crap out of each other my favorit weapon use in that tournament wa a giant wooden hammer use to beat a poor contend to bloodi pulp and my favorit contend undoubt wa that one brute with the warthog head reminisc of the gamorrean guard from return of the jedi i won t reveal how the movi end but just prepar to ravish in delight when i tell you a way dismember is thrown into the movi s climax and of cours there s a wonder display of ineptitud throughout the whole movi see a guy be drag behind a hors over a dirt road and the next point of view shot show him be drag over grass no road see that awesom tattoo on the sorcer s head magic chang side within the same scene on shot ha it on the left side of his head the other on the right well after all munkar is a magician it s that or this movi wa shot in an altern univers where thing like continu simpli don t exist a much a i enjoy this and a much a i am look forward to the other instal in this seri i do have enough shred of decenc left in me to not let this movi pas i am prepar though to give it the maximum amount of minim point just so i could be abl to deduct a coupl of more point for the possibl inferior sequel to follow deathstalk might be a superbl fun trashi sleazi conan rip off it also is an abomin movi

hm while an enjoy movi to poke plot hole point out atroci act primit at best special effect all of which have caus me to view this movi three time over the past six year sever rank among the worst i ve ever seen i m never sure who the protagonist are all i know is that the killer use a portabl guillotin a seen in the danc floor murder scene all in all i don t realli like the movi becaus onli the first minut are enjoy the rest is a mishmash of confus dialog and imageri that fail to progress the stori to a logic conclus which i can t rememb anyway 
 
 
 
this is one of them movi that ha a awesom video box but ha wire camra work and unknown actor that speak with bad dialogu it so dark when the kill happen you can hard see it plus the movi is hard to understand the onli star in this is wcw`s vanessa sanchez tygr in wcw befor it fold and she is a good actress i like low budget film especiali one that ha error becaus they are fun to watch but sever unfourtunat isn`t one of them this movi is ok to see if you like voodoo and sever head but this is no blockbust but if you need someth new to watch then rent sever 
 
 
 
i went to the movi a a sneak preview in austria so didn t have an idea what i am go to see the stori is veri normal the movi is veri long i believ it could have cut to without caus ani problem to the stori it the type of movi you can see in a bore night which you want to get bore more ashton kutcher wa veri good kevin costner is ok the movi is speak about the u coast guard how they are train their life style and the problem they face a there aren t much effect in the movi so if you want to watch it then no need to wast your money and time go to the cinema would be more effect to watch it at home when it get on dvd 
 
 
 
after look at monkey oop ape for more than one hour i wa feel like one too i wa an ape spend money on this movi plea peopl hold you money in your pocket and go see some funni movi like bridget jone s diari 
 
 
 
there s noth quit like watch giant robot do battl over a desert wasteland and robot war doe deliv sure the act is lousi the dialogu is sub par and the charact are one dimension but it ha giant robot the special effect themselv are actual quit good for the period they are certain not a polish a today s standard but it contain a minimum of comput graphic and instead use miniatur so it ha age fair well it shortcom are easili overlook given the film short runtim and it doe have a certain tongu in cheek humour in part that make it quit enjoy i would recommend this to ani fan of giant robot or cheesi sci fi who is look for a lightheart hour of distract 
 
 
 
this movi doesn t have an aw lot to do with it s predecessor robot jox this must be also the reason whi it most common name is robot war and not the altern name robot jox robot war robot jox wa basic a fun movi to watch becaus it had a nice premis of giant robot battl each other in the near futur this concept ha been abandon for this movi and instead it featur a total dull stori that besid isn t veri origin or clever written a shame it tri to be so much differ from it predecessor realli for el this perhap could had been a more fun movi to watch just like robot jox this is a b movi but with a a big differ that it s just not a veri good one perhap this also ha to with the fact that robot jox got made dure the s when b movi still had a certain bit of charm and class over it even though the movi got releas in this realli can t be said about this movi it s just lame bad made poor look and not excit enough it also ha an end which leav you think this is it that s all what the movi it stori is lack is good clear main plot line realli perhap a good main villain would had been a good idea and some other stuff such a an actual point to the stori some action or likabl main charact serious what were they think when they pick the actor for this movi all of them are simpli not likabl in their role and especi don michael paul is annoy a the main charact who behav a if he s god s gift to woman and mr perfect who can compet with anyon weren t they even simpli abl to get the actor from the first movi for such a futurist movi with a concept of have larg battl droid in it this movi sure is lack with it action had they put some more and bigger action into the movi the movi would at least had been a more entertain one to watch instead now we have a movi that fail to impress in basic everi way imagin you can better watch a mighti morphin power ranger episod for some more action and likabl

i basic pick up this movi becaus i had seen kitano takashi s brilliant remak of zatoichi and wa in the mood for anoth updat samurai tale which also star asano tadanobu these two movi are world apart zatoichi ad humor and depth to it charact and subvert tradit samurai movi clich s gojo goe off the deep end in the other direct first off i hate movi that have other charact inform the audienc what the main charact is like instead of have the charact develop over the cours of the movi you cannot decid whether you are a monk or a warrior say almost everi charact in benkei s presenc yet this inner turmoil is bare convey within the charact himself instead of charact develop we get bloat bore gori battl scene asano s charact is undevelop and even he look like he is bore and doesn t know what he is do there i know that he usual look distant and cool and that is part of asano s appeal but this movi doesn t serv him a lot of the camera movement is nauseat there is a scene that goe on forev in which the camera spin around the main charact until my wife and i felt like vomit the end is ridicul and rather anti climat it too bad that realli good samurai movi aren t be made in japan nowaday with this type of budget the color sceneri and costum were great but the rest is just a loooong wast of time i would rather see one of the kabuki version of this myth 
 
 
 
sogo ishii can be a skill filmmak under the right condit but gojo tell the stori of a warrior monk and his onli rival a scion of the genji clan the film make ha the main hallmark of a low budget product includ blurri fight scene and clumsi montag the kind you might find in an under produc dorama the monk benkei inform his spiritu teacher that his destini lie in defeat the mysteri spirit that guard gojo bridg at night but he doesn t realiz that this decis will bring him squar into conflict with near everi element of societi at that time but which could earn him enlighten there s no absenc of ambiti howev in it depict of the conflict between the holi and the world artsi flourish in some of the photographi and edit help to compens for the loo film make style a disappoint 
 
 
 
i am curious is realli two film in one half of it is the sexual experiment side of lena and the other half is her curio with polit social whatev the director s intent the two don t realli mesh togeth the director should have just stuck with the romant side of lena and made a separ movi for the polit there is a bizarr mixtur of polit war ralli dr king serious polit interview flop breast and pubic hair the film feel more like a fiction documentari than a movi other than the interest sex scene you ll be bore dri watch this film unlik mani other review i think the nude sexual scene are overdon for what it is if you want to see real porn i m sure there are better choic the pervas nuditi is a major distract from whatev plot there is i think the cast did a fine job howev they play their part believ there is littl of the over the top i m so use to see in the american film dure this time 
 
 
 
all i could think of while watch this movi wa b grade slop mani have spoken about it s redeem qualiti is how this film portray such a realist represent of the effect of drug and an individu and their subsequ spiral into a self perpetu state of unfortun event yet realli the techniqu use a mani have alreadi mention were overus and thus unconvinc and irrelev to the film a a whole a far a the plot is concern it wa lacklustr unimagin implaus and convolut you can read most other report on this film and they will say pretti much the same a i would grant some of the actor and actress are attract but when confront with such bore action look can onli carri a film so far the action is poor and intermitt a few punch thrown here and there and a final gunfight toward the end noth realli to write home about a other have said bad movi are great to watch for the veri reason that they are bad you revel in that fact this film howev is a void it s noth furthermor if one is realli in need of an educ movi to scare peopl away from drug use then i would serious recommend ani number of other movi out there that board such issu in a much more effect way requiem for a dream trainspot fear and loath in la vega and candi are just a few exampl though one should also check out some more lightheart film on the same subject like go overal both serious and funni and halfbak on a final note the one possibl redeem line in this movi deliv by vinni jone wa stolen from lock stock and two smokl barrel to think that a bit of that great movi ha been taint by load is vile overal i strong suggest that you save you money and your time by not see this movi 
 
 
 
this movi is just like everi other dutch movi so if you enjoy movi such a turk fruit and de klein blond dood then you might be okay with this one even though those two have much better stori and actor zomerhitt start strong enough but even that one good scene end up have noth to do with the storylin there s a lot of nuditi but me and other just could not find that girl attract the dialog is laughabl a we did a lot to the annoy of other movi watcher and some of the scene are so complet random that this is more of an unintent comedi than anyth el like a random scene in which an owl rip somebodi s eye out it ha noth to do with anyth and is onli referenc onc later in a sentenc say did you hear what happen i wa there the onli reason i gave it a is becaus some of the place they are at look nice that s it and the reason i saw it wa becaus we went to the sneak preview here in holland we have a strang system regard sneak preview you pay le money then for a regular movi and you don t know what movi it is that you will be watch all you know is that it s a new movi that s not yet in the theater my advic is to stay far away from this film if you realli want to see a good dutch movi watch temmink or zwartboek

here wa no effort put into valentin to prevent it from be just anoth teenag slasher film a sub genr of horror film of which we have seen entir too mani over the last decad or so i ve heard a lot of peopl complain that the film rip off sever previous horror movi includ everyth from halloween to prom night to carri and a much a i hate to be redund the rip off is so blatant that it is imposs not to say anyth the punch bowl over poor jeremi s head earli in the film is so obvious taken from carri that they may a well have just said it right in the movi `hey everyon this is the director and the follow is my carri rip off scene enjoy but that s just a suggest spoiler the film is structur piec by piec exact the same way that everi other goofi teen thriller is structur we get to know some girl briefli at the begin she get kill peopl wonder in the old oh but that stuff onli happen to other peopl tone and then they start to get kill the problem here is that the director and the writer clear and honest want to keep the film mysteri and suspens but they have no idea how to do it take jason for exampl here is this hopeless arrog guy who is so full of himself and bad with woman that he divid the check on a date accord to what each person had and a one of the first charact seen in the film after the brief histori lesson about how bad poor jeremi wa treat he is assum to carri some signific besid that and more import he ha the same initi a the littl boy that all the girl terror in sixth grade and the same initi that are sign at the bottom of all of those vicious valentin s day card it is not uncommon for the audienc to be deliber and sometim success misl by the behavior of one or more charact that appear to be prime suspect and jason is a perfect exampl of the effort but not such a good exampl of a success effort sure i thought for a while that he might veri well be the killer but that s not the point we know from earli on that he is terribl with woman which link him to the littl boy at the begin of the film but then in the middl of the film he appear at a parti smile flirtati at two of the main girl and then give them a hate look and walk away disappear from the parti and from the movi with no explan we alreadi know he is a cardboard charact but his role in the film wa so poor thought out that they just took him out altogeth when they were done with him on the posit side the killer s true ident wa in fact made difficult to predict in at least one subtl way which wa also unfortun yet anoth rip off earli in the film when shelley stab the killer in the leg with his own scalpel he make no sound suggest that the killer might be a femal stay silent to prevent reveal herself a a femal rather than a male a everyon suspect but then for the rest of the film we just have this stolid relentless unstopp killer with the emotionless mask and that gigant butcher knife director jami blank who with all due respect look like he had some troubl with the girl himself in the sixth grade mention be influenc by halloween this is of cours complet unnecessari becaus it s so obvious from how bad he plagiar the film the onli differ between the killer in valentin and michael meyer s is that michael s mask wa so much more effect and he didn t have a problem with noseble this stuff is shameless at the end there is a brief attempt to mislead u one more time a to who the killer is complet with slow and drawn out `and the killer is mask remov but then we see adam s nose start to bleed a he hold kate his often reluct girlfriend and we know that he s been the killer all along noth in the film hint that he might be the killer until the final act and these unexplain noseble were not exact the cleverest way to identifi the true killer at the end of the film valentin is not scari i watch it in an empti hous by myself after midnight and i have been afraid of the dark for a long a i can rememb and even i wasn t scare and the charact might be possibl to care about if it weren t so obvious that they were just go to die i rememb be impress by the theatric preview although the film wa in and out of the theater s faster than battlefield earth but the end result is the same old thing

the concept of the legal gray area in love crime contribut to about of the movi s appeal the other can be attribut to it s flagrant bad ness to say that sean young s perform a a so call district attorney is wooden is a gross understat with her bland suit and superflu hair gel young doe a decent job at convinc the audienc of her devout hatr for men whi el would she ask her onli friend to pose a a prostitut just so she can arrest cop who tri to pick up on them this hatr is also the onli reason whi she relentless pursu a pervert photograph who give woman a consensu thrill and the drive forc behind this crappi movi watch young go from frigid to full frontal nuditi doe littl to rais interest but the temper tantrum she throw stand next to a fire by a lake doe watch her rant and rave about her self loath and sexual frustrat make love crime worth the rental fee but it s all downhil to and from there despit her urg to bring patrick bergin s charact to justic her polic skill complet escap her in the throe of her own tire lust and passion patrick bergin doe a decent enough job a a slimi sociopath if it work in sleep with the enemi it sure a hell can work in this but i can t help but wonder if the notic lack of energi young bring to the film conflict with his slimi i m guess it doe and the result is a thriller with thrill that are thorough bad and yet comed

it s hard to believ an action pack jet li movi could be so bore but this wa transcend trash the plot is an amalgam of other hong kong chopsocki flick the martial art action is all special effect and no human talent it s a comic book stori about a group of super human soldier who are to be kill becaus they re mental unstabl one of their number li who hold off an incompet armi to save them and rebuild a life a a pacifist librarian the save killer resurfac with an austin power qualiti plot to take over the world and li shed his new life to save the world the version i saw wa dub and that may have accentu the cheesi of the wafer thin plot and comic book cent special effect but i suspect even ninja turtl watch year old would have found this juvenil and hollow

this movi is more like a music video kusturica said in an interview from that when he is make movi he feel like make music and when he is make music he feel like make movi the best thing in promis me this is the music written by stribor kusturica kusturica said in the same interview that for him the dialogu in the movi are like nois promis me this ha veri littl nois i like life is a miracl it wa also like music video for the first minut and at some point later but it had a beauti plot promis me this ha no plot i wa await this movi with big expect becaus i ve read that the script ha been written by ranko bozic one of my favourit scriptwrit who particip also in life is a miracl ranko bozic write great dialogu but for kusturica they are nois and much to my regret i saw onli two dialogu which i could identifi a written by ranko bozic the other part of the script wa use by the director for make his chaotic music video for the music of his son stribor gordan mihic the man who wrote the script for time of the gypsi and black cat white cat said in an interview that kusturica never follow the script black cat white cat wa the onli script for which kusturica said that he will not touch it accord to gordan mihic after all kusturica come back to the script and if he doesn t he doesn t make a good movi and i think this is the case with promis me this he should have follow the script of ranko bozic promis me this is bill a a comedi but there are veri few moment which made me laugh the comed moment are in the same style a black cat white cat but are not that funni at all i think the differ come from the fact that black cat white cat wa written by gordan mihic howev i know some peopl who like promis me this they find it veri posit movi 
 
 
 
i did not expect a lot from this movi after the terribl life is a miracl it turn out that this movi is ten time wors than life i have impress that director writer is just joke with the audienc let me see how much empti can you audienc sustain dialogu are empti scenario is minimalist in few moment photographi is realli nice few sarcast line are semi funni but it is hard to genuin laugh dure this comedi i ve laugh to myself for be abl to watch the movi until the end if you can lift yourself abov this director s fiasco you will find good act of few legend miki manojlov aleksandar bercek and veri good perform of emir s son stribor kusturica in short too bad for such a great director emir kusturica is still young and should be make top rate movi instead he choos to do this low budget just for my privat theater movi with arrog attitud toward the world trend and neglig toward his old fan 
 
 
 
not realli spoiler in my opinion but i want to cover myself nevertheless a the execut produc morgan freeman want the audienc to ignor the numer absurd of his charact in item or le a movi with an intent indi feel and just be absorb in the mentor be all that you can be theme he play a altern univers semi wash up version of the real morgan freeman who is chauffeur in an old econovan by a kid all the way into carson ca from brentwood to research his next movi role whi carson is a mysteri to so cal resid he could have save the trip and gone anywher in the san fernando valley and found the same element paz vega is pretti to watch a cross between salma hayek and penelop cruz play a disgruntl groceri checker at a larg but slow local market that appar is the ultim sourc for moragn freeman s research his charact is onli known a him to allud to how actor are regard when encount in real life by averag peopl psst that s him etc unfortun i wa too distract that him had all kind of world wisdom and advic but had no reliabl return back to his home in brentwood carri no cash or debit card or had the wisdom to keep a cell phone with him if one ha such a high opinion of their self that they believ they posse an answer to everyth like him doe then i gotta see cash and a blackberri which display intellig and good surviv instinct to preserv that big ego which him definit ha noth realli happen in this movi i don t believ that either of the main charact s were substanti chang by their encount with each other it flirt with the idea of adulteri but then that thought fizzl this to me wa similar to steve martin s shopgirl without the sexual affair it wa self indulg for freeman and unconvinc to the audienc 
 
 
 
a still famous but decad actor morgan freeman ha not film for four year when he is invit to particip in a new project he ask the clumsi cousin of the director to drop him in a poor latin neighborhood in carlson to research the work of the manag of a small supermarket he see the gorgeous spanish cashier scarlet paz vega and he becom attract with her abil his driver never return to catch him and scarlet give a ride to the actor but first she ha a job interview for the posit of secretari in a construct compani and the actor help her to be prepar then they spend the afternoon togeth have a pleasant time i am a big fan of morgan freeman and paz vega howev the pointless item or le is absolut disappoint this low budget movi doe not seem to have a storylin and is support by the chemistri and improvis of morgan freeman and paz vega and actual noth happen along minut the ambigu open conclus is simpli ridicul with the charact of morgan freeman return to his silver spoon world and tell the simpl worker that they would never see each other again wa he afraid to have a love affair with her and destroy his perfect world with his famili or wa a clash of class and he realiz that his fanci neighborhood would not be adequ to a simpl worker from the lower class my vote is four titl brazil um astro em minha vida a star in my life 
 
 
 
this movi wa great the first time i saw it when it wa call lost in translat but somehow bill murray turn into an eccentr black man play by morgan freeman scarlett johansson turn into a cranki latino woman play by paz vega and tokyo japan turn into carson california instead of meaning convers and silenc we enjoy in translat we get meaningless blabber in item that verg on annoy instead of charact that were pensiv and introspect a in translat we get charact that spew pointless advic on topic they have no clue about how can a charact that wear hundr dollar t shirt and ha never been insid a target depart store expect to give advic to a work class woman on how to prepar for a job interview a an administr assist don t think that stop him if he isn t give her cloth advic he s tell her what she should eat the most annoy part of the movi for me wa how suppos they were in a hurri to make an appoint and yet the charact keep find time to run anoth errand be it wash the car stop at arbi s or just lay around to list off their item or le list of thing they love and hate i kept want to yell at them say didn t you say you had somewher to be what the heck are do a minut ago you were practic late now you re eat roast beef and ponder your live until i saw this movi i never truli understood how someth could insist upon itself but i think this movi doe exact that and undeserv so the dialogu make the charact cheesi and unsympathet with the except that i felt sorri for both of the actor for have sign onto this project 
 
 
 
after i watch this movi i came to imdb and read some of the review which compar it to lost in translat lite when i read that i immedi could see the review point this movi wa a poor attempt at a similar theme interest the format of the movi is near ident but the pace is incred differ item rush the viewer through the day time line of the movi wherea the better plan lost in seem to stretch out over a few long day i m sure some peopl will see this becaus it ha morgan freeman and will be disappoint it seem his better role now a day are support role in big blockbust rather than lead role in sub mil limit releas movi and indi film

this is a horribl littl film and unfortun the compani that made this short made sever other the short is essenti a one joke idea that wasn t funni to begin with and may also offend you it certain made me uncomfort watch veri young child most appear about year old cavort about and pretend to be adult in this case a dancehal girl and bar room patron it s the sort of humor that you might be forc to laugh at from your own kid if they pretend to be adult but i can t see anyon want to see this especi when a veri young shirley templ is dress in a rather slinki outfit and act like a vamp and then other kid act like adult in some rather adult situat at the time i am sure they were not tri to appeal to pedophil but when look at it today that is what immedi come to mind becaus of this this bore film also creep me out and i hope to never see it again pretti strang and pretti aw 
 
 
 
i rent the dub english version of lensman hope that sinc it came from well known novel it would have some substanc while there were hint of substanc in the movi it most didn t rise abov the level of kiddi cartoon mayb the movi wa a bad adapt of the book or it lost a lot in the dub version or mayb even the sourc novel were lightweight but for whatev reason there wasn t much there i notic lot of detail that were deriv sloppi poor dramat or otherwis defici some exampl the open scene look borrow from the star gate scene and the star war imag of hyperspac the robot on the harvest look like an anthropomorph r d it start out tri to borrow it comic relief style of star war but merci sinc the humor doesn t work give up on comedi and play it serious in that sen it s superior to the star war franchis which start with a clever sen of humor and eventu deterior to jar jar s annoy silli the agricultur detail were appar drawn by someon who had never seen a farm the harvest wa drive through the unharvest middl of a field dump silag onto unharvest crop rather than work from one side to the other and dump the silag onto alreadi harvest row or into a truck corn maiz wa pour out the grain chute but the farm land were drawn like a wheat field when it wa time for kim s father had to face his fate there wasn t ani dramat weight to the scene that could have been part the fault of the english languag voic actor but the draw didn t show much weight either kim s reaction in that scene were similar unconvinc similar when a charact name henderson wa kill chris show veri littl reaction even though they were appar suppos to have been close henderson s death is no spoiler his name isn t reveal until his death scene she seem to prompt forget him someon s express of sympathi show more feel than she doe i think the voic actor deserv most of the blame in that case there s at least a hint of feel in the draw of chris on sever occas villain fail to accomplish their order a villain leader often punish those failur with miser death i can t say whether that s lift from star war or if that come from an earlier sourc possibl the lensman book there s a scene where a space ship crash land a it plung toward the ground part are break off the ship but so mani piec are fall off that there should be noth left of it by the time it land while in most case chris seem like a compet tough space hero there s a scene where she shriek like an incompet damsel in distress someon tough enough to get over henderson s death so quick should at least be abl to shout help it s got me and i can t reach my gun instead of just shriek the charact with the most person almost too much at time is d j bill he sound like wolfman jack the d j in american graffiti i wonder if he s a well voic in the origin languag two planet in the movi explod the explos were unimpress and appear to owe a lot of inspir to star war to it credit howev the caus of the explos wa complet unlik the death star s primari weapon the dialog had a good interest explan for the caus mani other explos in the movi did look good just not the planetari explos some of the sound effect are veri cheesi a if borrow from a late s video game some of the imag look like primit video game and some influenc from tron is visibl too on the other hand the sound effect are often pretti decent although that emphas the cheesi sound part the art is good too particular when it stay away from the often cheesi look comput graphic final there s the stori if a movi tell a good stori it can get away with a lot of product shortcom but the plot here wa pretti lightweight a na ve boy tri to help someon on a crippl space ship and acquir a great power he doesn t understand he and his band of veri virtuous companion struggl against a power unredeem evil enemi he make friend learn about his special power and grow into a young man if he is persist and virtuous enough he might even defeat the evil enemi detail along the way can make such a stori rise abov the simpl outlin but there s veri littl more than that in this movi in the end it s just a kiddi cartoon but then sinc it look like the primari intend audienc is older child mayb it doesn t need to be anyth more than that

this is the worst imagin crap the novel by h rider haggard is veri entertain and dramat the maker of this worthless movi don t follow it close well old novel aren t sacr and make free version of them is fine with me if one ha idea of one s own if all one can do is chang thing and replac them with uninterest and water down clich s one should stick to the origin if they had done that this film would have been at least twice a good even with wors actor and if film insid a studio with hut made of cardboard but there s no imagin at all onli tired this should be bought or watch onli by collector of victorian novel made into movi just a hint and not a spoiler i think to make those of you who have read the novel understand what ha taken place and what you may expect if you decid to watch this on tv or god forbid wast money on buy this gagool an old baddi witch in the book and some precursor to gollum ha been turn into a nice gal 
 
 
 
start of with the good bit sever time swayz talk zulu to his friend or that languag is heard among the tribe that s a great plus a normal usa uk movi audienc think all peopl on this planet speak english just in case you re one of them no they don t but the act is tenenkrommend a we say in the netherland it make your toe curl and not in a good way i like swayz but in this he s aw the muscl in his jaw make overtim and he s frown the whole movi some one must have told him it look butch no patrick it look silli and is compens for lack of charact alison doodi elizabeth ha opt for a style of act that doe not meet the style of her co worker her act is s relax that this movi could have been set in the current day and it s not your frock wa a clue alison the best act came from the peopl from the african contin and side onyulo a umbopa i like best clear warm and in charact his perform is a joy to watch general it is mwah entertain on a raini day piti could have been better sack the director

ok not bad movi make if it were from an origin script but it is not which part of in this stori there are no woman except for foulata and gagoola introduct by haggard did the produc director and writer not understand i mean it is pretti plain english i understood it at age the beauti of ksm is that it contain a spectacular descript of three differ world the coloni africa the unforgiv desert and kukuanaland a hidden and isol kingdom that should be more than enough for even the most mediocr of produc to work with but nooo they have to throw romanc into it pathet suggest to all you poor soul who actual thought this would be close to the book give it up until a peter jackson wannab come along and doe it right you may a well keep re read the tome btw there is a sequel book actual a pre quel call allan s wife it give background to the stori of quatermain it is a bit creepi but good

i have recent watch this movi twice and i can t seem to understand whi the h ll the maker made this pile of crap i mean yes it give a great impress of hitler s environ and i mean the way they reproduc austria in the late s wwi and the inter war period what i can t understand is whi they pictur hitler a a pure evil mad unreli mental unstabl freak he wa after all a veri thought love and intellig man who of cours had his dark side no doubt about that but whi in heaven s name portray him in this way all of his posit aspect have been cut out of the scenario leav noth but a veri propaganda like portrait of a man who had the biggest influenc on modern civil ever yes he threw germani into the devast nd world war yes he wa racist and yes he wa at time menial unstabl especi at the end of the war all true but again whi the hell did they plain lie to the public to warn u i absolut don t think this movi wa a warn the true danger of hitler and the nazi s wa the fact they were abl to rise to power at moment of sever global weak the fact this evil wa so recogniz yet so embrac by almost everi german aliv not to mention austrian and a lot of other peopl make it a warn to modern civil not the fact hitler wa such a weirdo if it would have been like the maker make u believ i would have been convinc that the german peopl were retard a man like the one in this movi would have never gotten anywher near parti leader not to mention reichskanzl 
 
 
 
simpli put this is a simplist and one dimension film the titl the rise to evil should tell you that this isn t go to attempt to be anyth deep or do much with hitler s charact rather from the first minut of the movi where we see babi hitler look evil with evil music play the background we are given a view of hitler that present his a a cartooni supervillian seem rip right out of a saturday morn tv show the film realli want to make it case that hitler wa evil but doe anyon need a movi to convinc them that hitler wa evil ultim make him such a one dimension evil charact is both bore and confus one must ask how the inept phsycot charact in the film cold ever persuad a nation to follow him or be name time s man of the year this film had a great opportun to take a figur who ha commit some of the most horribl act in the th centuri and tri to delv into his mind instead it basic just say hey hitler wa evil just thought you might like to know over and over again the great ironi is that the film still wa attack for present too sympathet a view of the charact give me a break 
 
 
 
i watch this film few time and all i can say that this is low budget rubbish and that it doe not have anyth to do with a real histori fact actor perform is veri poor but it is result of limit act possibl anyon who watch this film now probabl think of hitler a some crazi skinni lunat who run with a gun like some chicago gangster i can onli to say that there is much better film about hitler and germani in those year and that rise of evil is veri much under averag i can recommend german film downfal in which you can see brilliant perform of switzerland actor bruno ganz in a roll of adolf hitler 
 
 
 
this is by far one of the most bore and horribl act account of the earli day of adolf hitler that i have ever watch robert carlyl is a wonder actor but to cast him a hitler is just plain wrong to cast liev schrieber a hitler s longtim friend and aid haefengst must have emit cri of despair and anguish from the simon wiesenth centr a j w play a nazi support bad bad bad cast this wa not an enjoy famili film with a good histor background this wa hollywood rubbish at it finest cash in on the strength of a strong but sore under util support cast of actor whom seem to have all but disappear from the act radar in the past year the fake german accent vee vill vin zis var is insult to german peopl everywher my mother is german and she sat fume at the sound of the voic which kept switch from american english german all in the same sentenc the support cast make better cardboard cutout at the local video store than they do on screen jenna malon a the fate geli raubal wa splendid though she captur the innoc and confus of this tragic young woman who ultim end her own life to escap what her futur would have been like in hitler s shadow if you would like a tremend fantast and histor accur account of hitler s earli year lead up to and includ the war holocaust rent insid the third reich star rutger hauer a albert speer and derek jacobi a hitler it wa good and made more sen then this baloney a a histor research of the third reich i can honest tell you this had me reach for my book to confirm it myriad of inaccuraci 
 
 
 
 a usual i wa realli look forward to a new tv film on a favourit subject of mine make a nice chang from a strang familiar documentari about kursk or stalingrad on the histori channel i avid look forward to pearl harbour and enemi at the gate but wa rude brought down to earth with the realis of the malevol stupid ifi power of hollywood and it abil to spend an absolut fortun on tripe so yet again i got excit about the rise of evil especi a i heard that ian kershaw wa involv a i ve enjoy his book i can see whi he quit to quot some guy respons for this rubbish the kershaw book wa an academ piec he said it wa quit dri we need more incid incid are they total nut hitler s life cannot be said to be without incid yes kershaw s two volum hitler biographi were long and detail but they were suppos to be the thesi behind rise of evil seem to be hitler wa a veri bad man no he wa a veri bad man who hate jew and just in case you miss this we re go to emphasis the fact in everi scene in the film there wa no effort whatsoev to tri and explain the mood of the time and whi hitler may have adopt the view and strategi he did needle to say unlik the general excel nazi a warn from histori this film neglect to point out the fact that near all of the leader of the munich communist rise were jewish and that this may have colour his view on the subject and his axiomat link of the jew with bolshev an absolut crucial aspect to understand much of the nazi era but there wa not much understand to be done the film maker weren t go to go there so we just got all the stuff we knew about anyway we certain don t get the fascin fact that kershaw allud to which ha hitler briefli be a socialist communist immedi after ww that would of cours be far too complex for the film to handl and might even detract from the relentless he wa veri bad mantra which bang away incess we know he wa a bad man howev we also know that he wa a mesmeris figur both a a public speaker and in more privat situat he could be polit and even sympathet and of cours espous some view like vegetarian anti alcohol and anti smoke that mani guardian reader could agre with he wa also famous fond of anim henc whi that wholli invent dog flog scene wa so absurd he wa also from all the account i ve seen a brave soldier in ww whilst we saw him with his iron cross we never get to see how he won it act of braveri were not in the script needle to say we also get no insight whatsoev into whi he wa so fire up by his war experi whilst sassoon owen brook remarqu and so mani other found it so repel an experi and again like the point abov re the jewish bolshevik link this is vital to anyon s understand about the subject whi did he love war so much whi did he think it wa alway a good idea despit massiv evid to the contrari whi didn t he care about his colleagu who die or mayb he did but still drew the wrong conclus this film certain didn t have anyth of ani interest to say on this either a all too often these day the film is a classic exampl of make histori relev to the present and invent stuff or leav awkward fact out to fit in with the present which all too often is to cater to the lowest common denomin where you don t trust your audienc an inch so you just ram stuff down their throat know sad correct that you ll alway get away with it becaus there are so mani dumb fool in the world histori is realli about make u relev to the past and see how it colour our present for better and for wors this rubbish wa a great opportun lost again they spent million on it and the locat and larg scene were impress but told u noth at all we didn t know alreadi and promot no understand of this dark period in human histori wt
 
 
 
no wonder that the historian ian kershaw author of the groundbreak hitler biographi who origin wa the scientif consult for this tv film dissoci himself from it the film is histor just too incorrect the mistak start right away when hitler` father aloi die at home while in realiti he die in a pub in the film hitler move from vienna to munich in while in realiti he actual move to munich in i could go on endless hitler` childhood and youth are portray way too short which make it quit difficult for histor uninform peopl to understand the charact of this frustrat neurot man import person of the earli time of the parti like hitler` father friend dietrich eckart or the parti philosoph alfr rosenberg are total miss the character of ernst hanfstaengl is veri problemat in the film he is portray a a nobl charact who almost despis hitler the script obvious follow hanfstaengl` own gloss over view of himself which he gave in his biographi after the war in fact hanfstaengl wa an anti semit and wa crazi about his fuehrer but the biggest problem of the film is the portray of hitler himself he is character a someon who is constant unfriend ha neither charisma nor charm and constant order everybodi around after watch the film one wonder how such a disgust person ever wa abl to get ani follow sinc we all know what an evil crimin hitler wa natur everi scriptwrit is tempt to portray hitler a total disgust and uncharismat but fact is that in privat he could be quit charm and entertain his comrad didn`t follow him becaus he constant yell at them but becaus they like this strang man beyond all those histor mistak the film is well made the actor are first class the locat shot and the product design give a believ impress of the era

i am a big fan of the spaghetti western genr and i usual also like most of the cheapli made one infam director demofilo fidani howev is right known for some of the cheapest trashiest and well worst contribut to the genr the plot of fidani s movi were usual veri weak and sinc his talent wa quit limit he usual tri to sell the movi by ad famous spaghetti western name like django of sartana to the titl i the particular case of gi la testa hombr of he just took the titl of sergio leon s gi la testa aka duck you sucker and ad hombr the movi can be found under various titl fist of death western stori i person bought it under the name adio companero which this movi share with anoth fidani film with almost the same cast per una bara piena di dollari which is also entitl adio companero in the german languag version the plot is rather weak it basic follow a guy name macho callaghan jeff cameron and his involv with two rival outlaw gang lead by butch cassidi jack bett and ironhead gordon mitchel the lead perform by jeff cameron is kind state not veri convinc neither did i find jack bett veri good a butch cassidi b movi legend gordon mitchel howev is alway worth a tri and although he probabl wasn t a veri good actor i alway found his perform in the spaghetti western quit funni and origin and he actual save some of fidani s movi such a the rather crappi django and sartana showdown in the west there is one veri funni and origin thing about gi la testa hombr the great klaus kinski is play a priest i could have imagin kinski in ani role but befor see this movi i would never have guess that anybodi would cast him a a priest kinski is onc again great although he ha onli littl screen time and one scene where he break up a fight is probabl the onli good scene in this one more interest thing about this film is that the legendari director and king of sleaz joe d amato did the cinematographi gi la testa hombr is a cheap crappi film but nevertheless it ha some funni moment be a spaghetti western enthusiast i found it fun to watch but if you re not never mind this movi or watch it onli for the purpos of see kinski play a priest

i realli have problem rate this movi it is direct brilliant there is obvious a lot of money in it gere and dane are intens although her screen person could use a bit more defin and spice up edit and cinematographi are excel on the other hand it is one of those realli realli sick movi where one cannot help but wonder whether the director himself like to stage specif scene and yes one cannot help but wonder how mani copycat will such a movi inspir in pure artist term it is a but i realli have to ask myself who these peopl are give their money to produc such a movi 
 
 
 
a bad rip off attempt on seven complet with sub second grade act aw camera work half bake stori and strong aftertast of lame propaganda yeah them sex offend they live next door and you re gonna get rape realli no surpris from the vice terminatrix woman she act a alway a convinc a a piec of wood richard gere keep on slide lower and lower and is about a low here a a late steven seagal the singer woman with the crazi eye is best when she s dead in bed and even the wolf wa sub par although she wa the best perform in the movi mayb they fed her befor the shot or someth unlik seven which had a made up but interest stori to which one could relat more or le regardless of the countri this movi seem to focus on a u onli ob if one doesn t care much about sex offend and the statist are that lack of exercis and bad diet caus more pain suffer and death there is littl reason to see it or to be afraid there are some bodi part fetish and some snuff but the gore is le then mediocr and fail both a artist devic becaus it is pointless and a gore becaus it is not gori enough don t wast time on this one 
 
 
 
the flock is not realli a movi it s a wannab movi with wannab actor not includ richard gere he gave an excel perform but when onli one of the actor truli give himself to his charact and the rest of the cast is just act the result is pathet just like this movi you see the idea of act is to hide the fact that you re act what the hell wa clair dain do in this one she s the most inappropri actress for this charact in of the movi she look extrem out of place out of everyth the onli thing she wa do wa ask stupid question like do you realli think so and make silli face i wa embarrass by her act serious and i use to like her she s the romant movi type i don t know who pick her among all the actress out there lol and see avril lavign this realli made me laugh anyway if you want to get the feel of throw up this movi will do the job for you i wish i could vote 
 
 
 
i just saw this film yesterday my girlfriend want to see it onli becaus of richard gere i feel i wast my time and money and told my girlfriend it s the last time we go to see a film just becaus a certain actor actress is in it i hope she learn the lesson becaus i had troubl keep her in her seat a of me sinc i paid alreadi i want to see the end at least just in the hope someth good would turn up but i didn t hold my breath and luckili so caus i would have been a victim of the film just the same this is not a black and white film it s a black and black one the main charact richard gere is almost a bad a his registr and all sex offend are portray a unredeem hard core crimin and the bad one among them were realli veri veri bad speak of a clich and the exploit of a typic u phobia richard gere s act wa good a usual but the blond girl that s suppos to replac him wa wishi washi at best total unconvinc for the job the film tri to exploit a popular theme and give it a cheap dramat and sensat turn that just is unreal they just use sex offend a an excus to indulg in cheap violent act of murder vigilant beat rape and tortur someth that almost seem gratuit they even have a wolf attack peopl in the film how low can you get i gather the film won t come out in the usa and will go straight to dvd that s were it should have stay in other countri too but becaus it s hollywood and richard gere they just had to show it believ me without gere the film is not even worth a b seri movi 
 
 
 
in the titl i write that the stori is ludicr below i ll elabor and tell you whi it in my humbl opinion ruin this movi gere and dane are do their job and while it s not their best work it s quit ok the rest of the cast though is do a realli poor job mind you this is not entir the actor fault the problem is that gere and dane are the onli one that have charact that have even the slightest room in the movi to realli give ani depth all other charact have either too littl room in the movi to creat ani depth or the charact is such a clich that it doesn t matter how hard the actor tri the director ha a bit of a se en complex but look mere at the direct i think he doe an ok job but the stori this is the kind of script that is bad in two way first of all it s a bad movi script the charact are shallow except for gere s and dane charact the villain are clich s and the action of the charact is total unbeliev besid this the writer must have an agenda where they want to bring back our view and ethic a hundr year it s the kind of movi that are say that some crimin are still crimin regardless of the fact that they have paid the price the societi ha given them it s also the kind of movi that say albeit onli between the line that everi form of sexual devianc should be punish without trial judg or juri and of cours accord to the movi everyth that is not sex in the missionari posit by a marri coupl is a sexual devianc so if you re go to film school and need an exampl of a bad script or if you re write script yourself and want an ego boost see it for everyon el i recommend anoth movi

wa this tim meadow first act role in a movi the charact leon is funni enough but short after that the sexual joke and humor are too dumb to listen to anymor some movi can get away with the sexual joke and base their audienc to know that right when the advertis come on some movi that do this are american pie and scari movi scari movi wa stupid and american pie wouldnt have done well without the sexual joke the onli role besid leon that had some humor that follow wa will ferrel the charact realli wa dumb and that wa all the dumb humor wa all that had me watch the movi wa ok and noth el i dont realli understand whi the snl peopl that are die to leav the show alway get a movi base on a charact they play on the show the skit last about minut and if they can make a movi off a minut skit then what is the world come to molli shannon had superstar cheri o terri had scari movi but she wasnt a lead role and will had elf but that wa good but he did some dumb movi but i cant rememb and mike myer with wayn s world how come the mad tv crew dont ever get movi deal seen onli one guy break through but onli in like movi and a tv show with andi dick but that guy reli on comedi for his life to continu funni or not this movi is not good but had some posit humor what a wast of film and peopl s money d d 
 
 
 
i rent this tape a coupl of year ago and boy did it suck from the commerci i wa lead to believ that this wa a movi about a guy who had no no luck with woman and that wa where the comedi would lie boy wa i wrong the joke were vulgar and they were just not funni don t bother 
 
 
 
i think i laugh twice the line where the main charact say someth about be from the street and then i forget the other time i laugh it wa probabl in the begin this ha to be one of the thinnest movi ever doesn t hollywood realiz that this kind of humor is degrad and sad realli you can onli insult yourself so mani time 
 
 
 
i honest don t understand how tripe like this get made the worst junior high talent show skit you ve ever seen is more entertain than this film will ferrel s wrestl fetish provid the onli briefli humor moment utter horribl 
 
 
 
the ladi man is a funni movi there s not much thought behind it but what do you expect from an snl movi it s actual better than most snl movi i e superstar or a night at the roxburi tim meadow and will ferrel were both veri funni chris parnel wa also funni in his short scene one of the funnier one in the movi other than that the rest of the cast is averag and is just there to support meadow i ve definit seen funnier movi but i ve seen dumber one too again it s not exact a deep movi but it s good for a few laugh it wa funnier a a skit though but still if you re look for a pretti funni movi i d recommend this one just don t think about it too much or you ll hate it rate 
 
 
 
this film wa veri well advertis i am an avid movi goer and have seen preview for this movi for month while i wa somewhat skeptic of how funni this movi would actual be my friend thought it wa go to be great and hype me up about it then i went and saw it i wa sunk down in my seat almost asleep until i rememb that i had paid for this movi i made myself laugh at most of the stuff in the movi just so i wouldnt feel bad and destroy the good mood i wa in plus i want to get my moni worth out of the movi i alway go into a movi with an open mind not tri to go into them with too mani expect but this movi wa not that funni now it wasnt the worst movi i ve ever seen but it is definit worth wait for hbo if you havent seen mani preview for the movi or you like veri slow and corni comedi you may enjoy it but for true comedi fan id say pas mayb even check out the king of comedi again someth told me to go see meet the parent instead 
 
 
 
when i decid to watch the barbarian star those twin bodybuild peter and david paul i thought it couldn t be that bad becaus the film wa direct by ruggero deodato who ha a reput for creat sleazi movi but well made sleazi movi well the barbarian is remark trashi action adventur movi that want to be anoth conan the barbarian and fail at everi level the look of the film is all wrong some scene were well shot but the tone and the schintzi tacki disco look of the cloth and hair peopl are adorn with just doesn t make ani sen whatsoev even for a low budget flick like this one richard lynch look like an old woman with that ridicul hairdo and costum he s suppos to be menac but he come across a a buffoon and it s funni to see eva laru callahan one of the star of all my child appear in her first movi walk around in skimpi fur bikini i m sure she want this dreck to disappear from the face of the earth the so call barbarian twin are okay a the muscl bound hero but it s almost imposs to construct a proper critiqu of their act becaus their role are like everyth el in this mess realli ill conceiv the onli way the film tri to differenti one twin from the other is by have one twin wear a loincloth that cover his as while the other twin s loincloth bare cover his muscular butt i m not kid don t ask me who s who though deodato must have been realli desper to agre to make this film and his desper is reflect perfect in this trashi flick it s just bad 
 
 
 
the movi is basic a bore string of appal clich s which do not offer a real cross cultur insight the middl eastern leg of the journey is describ in a particular irrit way there obvious are mud brick villag dirt track in the middl of the desert woman clad in black robe and belli dancer i wonder how camel and date palm tree were miss from the whole pictur the person of the two main charact is veri clumsili sketch and mani situat are hard credibl the origin idea might have been interest but at the end of the day if you are look for cultur insight you should skip this movi 
 
 
 
this wa one of the worst movi i have ever seen the plot is aw and the act is wors the joke that are attempt absolutley suck don t bother to wast your time on a dumb movi such a this and if for some reason that you do want to see this movi don t watch it with your parent 
 
 
 
this may veri well be the worst movi i ll see if i live to be i think a group of first grader could have come up with better plot line a a class project than this i m dumber for have watch it and god have merci on the soul who were paid to produc this film and after i final turn it off i actual had the urg to vomit no one had a clue about photographi when made this no one had a clue about act no one had a clue about just about anyth i can t believ f x show this crap on occas the onli time i had seen it wa on one of the starz channel not even the main one and it wa on at about a m at that 
 
 
 
this is not so much film a big budget child s televis a far a i can tell the villain is a giant swarm of chocol cover espresso bean this theori seem to be verifi by the fact that the subtitl refer to it a insomnia when it s first mention that a civil had been wipe out by insomnia i thought wow a nihilist martial art film but no such luck although you have to consid it experiment cinema when the villain is strangl by an old man s long white eyebrow zu warrior make exact the same amount of sen whether the subtitl are on or off that s not a good sign i found the special effect to be somewher between ray harryhausen and xena warrior princess primit 
 
 
 
the movi use a cut edg titl for a lame stori kill kill would have been nice the movi incorpor taboo scene to make the viewer move back in their chair the scene are unnecessari and choppi the movi is someth a novic screen writer could have conjur just a wast of movi prop and network money i have to write line of text to critiqu this film when it is not worth line of my time but i have to push on to let the peopl know to avoid the nonsens if peopl are count on you to choos a good movi for movi night pick someth el if you have a soul don t damag it by subject yourself to this filth 
 
 
 
for the knowledg beatl fan the main valu in this movi is to just sit back and pick out the flaw inaccuraci combin event omit event wild exagger event omit peopl timelin error mi attribut quot incorrect cloth out of place song and shame shame incorrect instrument and other boner i just cant think of right now the flaw come fast and furious so you ll have to be on your toe i didn t give this a primarili due the fact that it is film in liverpool and the actor the band rain give it their all the lennon charact is credibl and doe a good job also the song cri for a shadow is heard at one point and that count for someth so watch it for fun but plea don t take it a histor accur 
 
 
 
weak plot unlik car malfunct and helpless fumbl charact at first i thought this movi wa made dure the seventi sinc the pictur qualiti a well a the storylin and drama seem taken from an old kojac episod when i check and found that it wa realli made a late a i wa astonish this is by far one of the worst and least thriller movi i have ever seen if you read this be advis if you see it you wast time when you could have done someth more excit like watch paint dri 
 
 
 
watch this movi made me think constant whi are they make such a problem out of some broken brake there are a million option to slow down the car in the movi speed the writer a least thought of a good reason whi the car wasn t abl to stop there aren t mani good thing to say about this film all the usual narrat clich s make their appear the actor are veri bad the stori is a leak a a siev etc that make this movi a wast of time and money 
 
 
 
quit one of the worst film i have ever seen terribl act laughabl action it s clear that the car are travel slowli atroci script hideous unsatisfi end and incompet direct make a hash of a movi we know judg reinhold is a fine actor but he should be asham of this detritus there is no great tension within the car and when the charact stumbl upon moment of hope they laugh like inan banshe for some reason even high five ing when they see the bridg lower also the chain of event that lead these peopl to share the same car strain credibl appar base on true event though if that s the case truth is evid stranger than fiction unfortun then that it wa portray in such an inept manner 
 
 
 
this film blanc classic tale of smolder passion ha achiev it well deserv legendari status a one of the screen s greatest saga of a doom and hopeless love the pervas ongo and progress magnet between judg reinhold and what s her name is sure to set mani a viewer s heart a flutter with memori of one s own first crush the brilliant screenplay dangl this embryon affair to be in front of the enraptur audienc sit transfix a the abstract almost expressionist cinematographi deep focus on the just under the surfac desir that ebb and flow between the princip you can cut the sexual tension with a dull tire iron a tini drop of perspir on the end of a nose catch the bright sunshin and leav no doubt a to it signific scene like this abound and bear watch again and again a with jane eyr and rebecca to which this masterpiec is so often compar the closeup of the actor face a they experi the slow dawn of the great love that is not to be will haunt you forev the now classic rc soundtrack score with it creativ and uniqu use of solo synthes emphas the emot that drip throughout like a leaki crankcas if i had ani critic at all by mention what i consid a minor flaw and dare to risk the wrath of the million of fan who hold this classic so dear to their heart i would say that the hallmark of runaway car it sen of mount sexual tension is briefli broken by the highway scene which now after repeat view seem just a bit overlong and probabl even unnecessari to the etern bittersweet tale of love interrupt dare i advanc what i perceiv a the tiniest of flaw in this critic acclaim triumph of modern cinema citizen kane had it rosebud runaway car should have it catchword a well perhap the film could have open with an extrem closeup of judg reinhold say someth such a a car is an extens of it owner and the rest of the storylin could then be dedic to par everi syllabl subtleti and nuanc of that phrase had that plot line been done this film could have top titan at the golden globe that year i m convinc my one regret that i didn t read the novel first 
 
 
 
imagin it say am your at home your bore your not tire this scenario occur about say or so year back i turn on the tv and flick over a few channel and found that this film wa on oh my word this is the worst film i have ever seen a runaway car that cant be stop co the brake have been cut or someth in cane it down the freeway what gonna happen this film wa so bad it actual funni i think the stunt cost about to make there wa one instanc where a babi small child is be winch from the car by a helicopt in an attempt to excit the viewer a conveni place bridg is near ahead this is the best bad bit of a film ever it show the child narrowli miss the bridg but it look so bad you can almost see the make of the dummi that they use total low budget classic cant rememb the end of the film though but i bet it wa great i doubt they will ever show this film again so i m glad i got to see this piec of trash 
 
 
 
ok first of all the video look like it wa film in the s i wa shock to find out it wa releas in second the plot wa all over the place right off the bat the stori is confus had there been some brief prologu or introduct the stori would ve been better also i appreci fantasi but this film wa too much it wa bizarr and bad film the scene did not flow smooth and the charact were odd it wa hard to follow and mayb it wa the translat but it wa even hard to understand i love chine epic film but if you re look for a chine epic fantasi film i would recommend the promis visual stun the plot is interest and good charact develop not this film bewar you will be disappoint 
 
 
 
this becam a cult movi in chine colleg student though i havnt watch it until it is broadcast in channel uk full of arti giddi pretent the plot is mediocr and unreal the spirit it want to convey is how independ artist resist the commercisli of music industri and maintain their puriti of an artist soul and wouldnt sell themselv for dirti money that is realli giddi and superfici the diologu are main pathet act is poor sceenplay is full of art pretent it is a fantasi movi for kid and that s all

i am probabl one of the few who actual read stephen king s book the one this movi wa base on after read this excel work i could not wait to see the movi version of it after view the movi i wa total disappoint the onli thing that this movi ha in common with the book is the titl and the name of the charact in the book schwarzenegg s charact is put on a game show the main object is to surviv but he s not in an arena he s set loo in the citi and ha to escap the game show s i guess you d call them villian who bear absolut no resembl to the movi charact this premis built much tension and suspens and end great with the climax the movi wa absolut garbag there wa no cinemat qualiti to it i total respect arnold schwarzenegg a an actor but he mess up with this one 
 
 
 
it is unbeliev that a script a clich and complet absurd could make ani screen even the small one the dialogu in this movi make catwoman seem like a high cultur classic billi zane play the bad as harmonica play elvi imperson gunsling martial art master who gambl on the life of a down an out former footbal player turn gambl addict play by the winner of nbc s craptast show next action star his perform is a cold a ice and not in a cool way the film take place in vega and sinc peopl play poker there the writer felt it wa a perfect set for a movi about a guy tri to surviv hour against an omnipres wealthi gambler who ha offer his target million if he can make it through the day and so the hunt ensu a hunt reek with unimpress explos construct yard set shoddi cinematographi and one liner contain the word bet or gambl the femal winner is also toss in the mix but for what reason i have no idea oh but don t worri na fan the loser make their memor cameo a well the surpris end will knock your sock off if you love predict or plagiar joel silver should reevalu his decis to sell out even more i wish he could give me those two hour of my life back 
 
 
 
hah so this is the movi that the next action star were get into well i m glad that i didn t particip and didn t win isn t it funni how one can just look at the first second and make up one mind about a movi i mean come on just look at those titl i watch this movi or part of this teleplay sinc it wa produc for tv and we couldn t bear to watch the whole thing one even while do my militari servic and the audienc with me wa the typic hodg podg of averag guy that onc in a while watch seri like la vega just for the girl in the show so the bar wasn t realli high the most watch movi in my group wa girl next door and it wasn t becaus of the great script d but this movi s total lack of origin act script and just about everyth el that make a movi good made it pretti easi to switch channel to la vega or wa it csi don t rememb without ani complaint by the rest of the group and that is rare for heaven sake don t by this movi if it s on tv then yes watch it and contempl on it my conclus well sinc joel silver ha inde produc some of the best action film out there die hard matrix to name some i can onli say that produc don t give the film it s qualiti they provid money for the director and to sell this movi just becaus it s a joel silver movi is just a desper attempt to conceal the obvious flaw of the crew who realli made it

what i found so curious about this film i saw the full hour roadshow version is how odd dispassion it is for a film about veri charismat men castro and che engag in a gargantuan polit struggl it s almost total devoid of emot fire the scene between benicio del toro and demian bichir who is at best a second level actor with a slight high pitch voic have no drama or depth and basic come down to castro tell che go here go there do this and that with no explan a to what effect or use this action will result in odder still is there is an actor in the cast who ha the requisit power to play castro joaquim de almeida but he s shunt asid in a minor part in the second half without the tension or passion that you would expect to fire these men and their follow the film becom a dullish epic length film about hairi beard men run through various jungl shout and shoot to no particular purpos or end sever of the review i ve read shower prais on the work of director steven soderbergh while ignor the actor almost complet one in fact spent more time talk about soderbergh s new digit film camera than the plot or actor or the fact that it s entir in spanish with english subtitl this is an odd odd thing to do sinc a soderbergh wa onli a hire gun on the film and b it s no more than a compet job of work with an unremark upon nod to oliv stone s jfk in the black and white cut up camera work when che visit new york if you can imagin red direct by andrew mclaglen instead of warren beatti you d get an idea of the dull compet of this movi 
 
 
 
i think that s this is aw produc and direct movi benicio del toro shouldn t work in product of movi he should put accent on his act and that s it steven soderbergh miss the whole point of the idea about revolut about it s ideal and most import about life of che guevara and so on camera is aw like someon with day work experi is shoot with it music is i don t know is there some music in the movi i will not recommend this piec of sh to no one it s just wast about hour in front of the tv or whatev i can t figur out how can someon rate this movi more than star disast disast disast disast don t watch plea save yourself from this miseri of movi 
 
 
 
the second half of steven soderbergh s revolutionari bio on che guevara deal with his last campaign to export revolut to bolivia in order to maintain his saint visag of che soderbergh conveni leap frog the mass execut he presid over after the revolut in cuba and the folli of his congo adventur this is the histori of a failur he write in the prefac of his congo journal to concentr fulli on che s attempt to ralli support to rise up against the govern in bolivia it would turn out to be a disast and guevara s final act what plagu the first chapter follow suit here a soderbergh slow his film to a crawl to studi the beatif counten of the contempl guevara onc again be play like jame dean in east of eden by bernicio del toro the problem is guevara ha littl success in gain convert and he soon find himself and his starv comrad be swallow up in the heart of dark bolivian jungl unlik werner herzog in the magnific aguirr the wrath of god soderbergh fail to util the jungl s metaphor possibl to heighten the desper of the guerrilla he seem more concern with keep che s nimbus abov his head than explor the panic set in on the dead ender there is one herzogian moment where che sit astrid an obstin hors kick and scream to get it move but overal soderbergh s mise en scene remain flat sloppi and uninterest in both of his film soderbergh show he is clear a che groupi and becaus of it his focus remain myopic and narrow he spend too much time build his monument to che and too littl in develop his relationship with key player in his saga especi fidel castro make matter wors he doe it with a slow and dispassion approach that never catch fire one would think he wa steep in enough eisenstein and vertov to realiz that sweep chang is showcas a lot better with sweep style

what an unusu movi absolut no concess are made to hollywood special effect or entertain there is no background music not special effect or enhanc sound facial express are usual cover by thick beard and the spanish languag is a strang monoton lilt that sound the same whether in the midst of a battl or talk around a campfir i sort of view these movi part and a an educ experi not realli someth to go and get entertain by it quit long and in place dull but i suspect that given the lack of ani plot develop i don t think it veri educ either it also difficult to perceiv ani stori from the movi dialogu it would be a good idea to read up a littl on the histori so that you can understand the context of what is happen sinc for some reason the director didn t see fit to inform the audienc whi che s band wa move around the way they did a a result there seem to be group skulk around the woodland for no particular reason and get shot at i would have love to give this movi more star for somehow generat more empathi with me and develop depth of charact but somehow all of the charact were still stranger to me at the end the star it get are for realism and show the hardship of guerrilla warfar 
 
 
 
i went to see this movi with the most posit expect i had seen jacquet s previous movi march of the penguin and had heard a veri posit review of this one on the radio howev i wa sever disappoint most of all this movi is terribl bore liter noth happen i tri to describ the content of the movi to a friend and we both end up laugh becaus i could onli stammer thing like well then the winter come and then spring and then there s an eagl and a river and one time it is dark and the girl goe into a cave and anoth time the fox ha babi and so on after about half an hour i began sigh yawn roll my eye cur the review at the radio station and hope that it would be over soon but the movi went on and on when it final end i had sunken so deep into my chair that i must have look somewhat similar to stephen hawk the most annoy part of the movi are a the girl who is obvious there to give child someon to identifi with she wear the same cloth throughout the entir movi one year and show exact two facial express joy and serious she is cute no question about that howev a movi about the beauti of natur like this one would have done better without her all too human presenc i found myself constant hope that she might get eaten by a bear drown in the river or someth similar terribl b the commentari by the girl s adult voic which tell u noth but neglig obvious bore redund thing c the music which is desper lack subtleti when the girl is happili jump around the music jump around too when the fox is threaten by an eagl the music becom threaten too it remind me of the veri earli day of film make and wa just too predict to enjoy admit mani of the child who saw the movi with me did obvious like it at least they got somehow involv thus my warn concern adult onli if you are over ten year old avoid this movi you can get a better and cheaper sleep in most other place

the one reason i rememb this is that it wa shown the week after nigel kneale` brilliant quatermass serial wa broadcast the trailer made heavi emphasi that the main charact had a mutil arm which had me hope he`d be like victor caroon from the quatermass experi stalk the street of london no such luck becaus the race game is just a rather drab thriller with the gimmick of have a hero with a physic disabl tri to get to the bottom of investig of corrupt hors race i suppos if you`r a fan of dick franci you might enjoy it but set it in the context of the late s when the sweeney had just finish and the profession wa still be produc there` someth lack about the race game one trailer featur a car over take anoth on a motor way if it`d been a trailer for the sweeney you`d see jack regan over take a car and beat a confess out of the slag who`d done a blag while the profession would have over taken a car and blown away the terrorist insid i think that sum up what` wrong with this series

it s unlik that anyon except those who ador silent film will appreci ani of the lyric camera work and busi but scratchi background score that accompani this releas although sound came into general use in there are no more than fifti word spoken to tell the stori of a woman unhappili marri who desert her husband for a younger man after a romant interlud in the wood the most vivid photograph scene ha the jealous husband give a lift to the young man for a ride into town proceed to drive normal until he realiz the man is his wife s lover in a frenzi of jealousi he drive at top speed toward a railroad cross but chang his mind at the last moment lose his nerv it s probabl the most tension fill scene in the otherwis decid slow move and obvious contriv stori hedi lamarr is given the sort of close up treatment lavish on marlen dietrich by her discover but her beauti had not yet been refin by the cosmetician a they were when she wa transport to hollywood her perform consist most of look sad and moro while mourn the loss of her marriag with onli brief glimps of a smile when she find her true love aribert mog the handsom young stud who retriev her cloth after a nude swim the swim scene is veri brief discreet photograph and not worth all the heat it appar generat the love make scene later on is also art photograph with the sort of lyric photographi evid throughout most of the film art so more is left to the imagin with the use of symbol and this is the sort of thing that ha other proclaim the film is some kind of lyric masterpiec not so it s disappoint primit crude in it sound portion includ the labori symphon music in the background and certain miss lamarr is fortun that loui b mayer saw the film and on the basi of it gave her a career in hollywood he must have seen someth in her work that i didn t it s appar that this wa conceiv a a silent film with the camera do all the work the jar worker scene at the conclus goe on for too long and is a jar intrus where none is need it fail to end the film on the proper note 
 
 
 
this is possibl the most bore movi in histori i wa realli look forward to see this movi given the actor director roman polanski i think i would rather see the three amigo than ever watch this movi again it prompt went from the dvd player straight into the garbag my apolog to those of you who appar like this movi howev you probabl like new coke a well i am at a loss to see whi anyon would have enjoy this movi it is slow dull and ha no real plot you wait for minut for the movi to get start i understand this wa made in howev this wa an era of bad televis all around thank god disco and three s compani are gone along with stop sign glass and the bay citi roller oh well just my thought 
 
 
 
this movi is terribl the suspens is spent wait for a point there isn t much of one asid from a few great line i found a tooth in my apart and the main charact dedic to kill himself it s a collect of suppos eeri sound 
 
 
 
extrem aspect ratio sound format mono a woman turn the tabl on a would be rapist when he mount an assault in her home and is forc to decid whether to kill him or inform the polic in which case he could be releas and attack her again exploit fan who might be expect anoth rough n readi rape fantasi in the style of day of the woman will almost certain be disappoint by extrem true farrah fawcett s charact is subject to two uncomfort prolong assault befor gain the upper hand on her attack a suitabl slimi jame russo but scriptwrit william mastrosimon and director robert m young take these unpleas scene onli so far befor unveil the dilemma which inform the moral core of this product would their final solut hold up in a court of law mayb base on a stage play which report left it actor batter and bruis after everi perform the film make no attempt to open up the narrat and reli instead on a confin set for the main action ace and technic credit are fine though fawcett s over subdu perform won t play effect to viewer who might be reli on her to provid an outlet for their outrag indign 
 
 
 
first of all this plot is way overdon girl want to make it everyon love her snobbi girl interven all look lost girl pull through everyon love her again etc throw in the fit in thing an attract male crush on the heroin plus singl parent troubl and it s so predict that you can practic recit along with it second of all i realli hate how they keep on dis classic music they send out the messag that everyon involv in classic music is uptight and snobbi and close mind in fact i don t recal the quot exact but i rememb at one point in the movi holli say whi do they have to be so uptight so classic it s realli insult how label classic music in this way third i ve went over it dozen of time but the onli reason that i can think of for make this movi is to promot britney spear there just isn t ani point at all and oh yeah while the actress who portray holli i m not sure whether that wa realli her sing or not had a reason good voic it wasn t a amaz a they were make it out to be especi when she wa belt she wa oversupport the whole time star 
 
 
 
it wa a decent movi i actual kind of enjoy it but the end is so abrupt there is absolut no closur and it leav ton of loo end what happen after the concert what happen with her boyfriend doe she hook up with grant doe she come beck in the next semest and what about angela obvious holli s perform would knock angela down a few peg but noth is shown to indic how she react there is so much left up in the air and it s veri unsatisfi i don t know if it is tri to leav room for a sequel or someth but it is a terribl end and i think that it realli make the movi a joke i wa veri disappoint 
 
 
 
i actual like this movi until the end sure it wa cheesi and pretti unlik but still it kept my attent on a raini afternoon until the end that is for her final perform at the prestigi classic conservatori where she ha struggl to catch up to the other classic train student what doe the main charact do wow them with her grasp and execut of this time honor music tradit no she tortur and butcher the great sensuous habanera from carmen and turn it into an utter forgett brittani spear wannab pop song my ear bled and in the suprem moment of horror her teacher gave her a stand ovat ani teacher not in a spear induc fantasi would have fail her on the spot save your time save your ear skip this movi

okay first of all i didn t sit down to watch the premier of a star trek seri to see a cowboy fli around in space this is how a normal enterpris episod work archer find a nebula or someth aloung the line of that and want to take a closer look but it might destroy the ship he send a shuttl into the nebula and and the shuttl get damag in all of the episod i have seen all of the problem are happen becaus of archer s stupid mistak oh and did you see the preview of one episod show archer and t pol kiss i wa plan to watch that episod but after that i total gave up on enterpris and turn to tv right off come on this is star trek also what wa with the banana slug in one episod hoshi had a banana slug but had to leav it behind for some stupid reason okay fine littl dumb to bring you pet slug in space but whatev okay that wa what i thought until they left it on a desert planet a banana slug cannot leav in a desert how dumb are these writer ani way just say if enterpris is on don t watch it 
 
 
 
i saw this in the market place at the cann film festiv it s a real cheapo prod noth wrong with that but you have to make up for it with a bit of sex or gore or both think larri cohen sean young is an interest actor well done to the produc for hook her i guess the open scene in the space ship come down is hilari you could pictur all the crew hand shake it around ha ha but i wish the peopl who made this well at least it s not pretenti 
 
 
 
the plot certain seem interest enough how can a real life brutal murder be turn into a truli bore movi well you can watch wonderland and find out i had heard of the wonderland murder befor this film wa releas and found it to be an interest true stori of some genuin sadist peopl unfortun there is zero charact develop so we never get a chanc to understand whi ani of this wa done or get a good sen of the interrelationship between the charact the pace of the direct wa veri tedious this all lead to an extraordinarili bore movi given that dawn schiller a central charact a holm s girlfriend wa an associ produc and that holm s wife wa a consult on the film we should have had the opportun to gain some real insight into the charact 
 
 
 
val kilmer solid perform dylan mcdermott solid perform josh luca solid perform three veri engag actor give decent perform the problem is who care about the plot john holm infam for his well endow a drug addict and a guy who despit contract aid continu to make adult film just doe not make an intrigu charact the stori surround the event lead up to and the aftermath of a vicious mass murder that occur in the late s in los angelo to which holm wa link arrest and charg with murder and who ultim wa acquit just like in the case of o j the guilt factor regardless of the outcom rang quit high in the he did it zone there is no one to sympath with in this film a everyon is a self serv crimin there is just noth remot interest here 
 
 
 
unlik other i refus to call this piti excus for a movi a triumph of style over substanc i don t want to give style a bad name still it s the most apt descript that come to mind a pointless unpleas and ultim meaningless assault on the eye and ear wonderland leav one wonder onli whi the film wa made in the first place and who in their right mind gave the greenlight to this dreari and tangl mess a biographi of porn star john holm a studi of who the man wa whi he went into the busi and how it affect him great bound to be compel bound to be entertain bound to be enlighten and fascin on about a million level and i have zero interest in porn but a confus violent rashomon style studi of a seri of murder holm wa connect with after his career end who in hell care what insight do we gain this film complet ignor the most interest aspect of john holm s life that he wa a porno star wonderland might a well have been about anyon the fact that the main charact is the most famous male adult film star in histori is almost irrelev to make matter about a thousand time wors the pictur is load down with jerkoff gimmick annoy machin gun edit sloppi dogm camerawork unnecessari split screen graphic and anim etc etc in the absenc of a compel stori and uniqu main charact the director and i use the term loo ha thrown togeth a dozen or so techniqu from other film and decid to call the result mess a movi among these the trendi bleach bypass look of narc or traffic or minor report the frantic often incomprehens throw the piec of film in the air cut style of natur born killer or day later the fill everi moment of silenc with an old song to evok the period soundtrack of goodfella or blow the groovi retro titl sequenc of velvet goldmin or autofocus or catch me if you can the list goe on and on and on pathet i want to like this movi i had real hope for it wonderland avenu had been around for year had the context of the murder been emphas rather than the murder themselv i think it could have work had the murder and holm s grow involv with seedi l a type signal the end of a career or the end of the swing s i think the film could have had mean it could have serv a purpos a it is meaningless pointless who care how mani perspect exist on a seri of murder general unknown by the public the case isn t famous enough to merit such painstak examin this film should have been the third act of the john holm stori that s it period and it could have work what s that oh right right they didn t want to tell a tradit rise and fall stori they didn t want to make boogi night or goodfella or star or autofocus they want their film to be differ right well in one sen they succeed there s a big differ between those film and wonderland the differ is those film are good

takashi shimizu had a great opportun with a remak of his origin film ju on the grudg while i haven t seen that film i would have to wager that there s more imagin and origin or some rip off origin in other word skill with known trope of the japanes ghost movi than in his own direct remak mayb the script wa written to somehow have some kind of warp appeal or i would guess access for an american audienc what start off with some potenti the hint of someth veri screw up go on with bill pullman s sudden movement just goe into a total jumbl and a a horror movi gimm a break tension could have been built on the situat a nurs go to take care of a disturb woman in a hous that is haunt but he undercut everyth he want to get his audienc to feel scare how s about some music time just so you know when exact to expect someth a black cat yeah whi not just make the ghost boy thing sound like a cat for creepi which in effect is onli creepi if you want cat plot whi not just shuffl between past and present without ani semblanc of an actual flow of how a stori could be told mean while the flashback are insert and are meant to be organ with the stori overal they aren t or for that matter have u care about anyon in the cast by the time the charact or those that are there for exposit get around to tell u what is go on or whatev there s littl point to care the film make is shoddi i e the degre rule is broken mani time over and not in a forgiv or intrigu way and the perform are wooden even when look frighten or shock gellar especi is disappoint but pullman who show up later after his first scene is sore miscast even when shimizu tri for some averag old boo scare like when the woman is in the offic build and chase by the grudg ghost it s still silli just watch when she s go on that elev and the ghost is in the background of shot either you ll go with it and if so more power to you or you ll laugh hyster at the result count me in the latter i m not total sure where this project went wrong wa it shimizu have to retool it for the studio or him not give enough leeway with his revamp of his vision or mayb raimi had some say in it and made thing more confus and or dull than they would be with someon el the grudg give u a lot of inform that doesn t make sen or at the least give u some horror fodder to chew on it s cineplex trash of a sad order

i am a great fan of david lynch and have everyth that he s made on dvd except for hotel room the hour twin peak movi so when i found out about this i immedi grab it and and what is this it s a bunch of crude drawn black and white cartoon that are loud and foul mouth and unfunni mayb i don t know what s good but mayb this is just a bunch of crap that wa foist on the public under the name of david lynch to make a few buck too let me make it clear that i didn t care about the foul languag part but had to keep adjust the sound becaus my neighbor might have all in all this is a high disappoint releas and may well have just been left in the delux box set a a curio i high recommend you don t spend your money on this out of 
 
 
 
i m somewhat of a fan of lynch s work so i wa excit when i found this dvd unfortun i wa veri let down it s a seri of short cartoon which attempt to show a disturb and disgust sort of humor the anim is veri crude no doubt done use macromedia each cartoon ha a big fat guy beat up his famili and general act like a jerk to everyon he know for peopl who are not familiar with this vein of anim they will probabl be somewhat impress by it howev if you ve spent much time on newground com like me then these cartoon will be no differ than ani of the other stuff you ve seen befor mani of the popular amateur artist on newground are do much better work than what wa shown on this dvd if lynch submit this work to the websit then he would blend in perfect with some of the better of newground artist but sinc i saw this on dvd instead of on newground i give it a instead of a a i would have otherwis these cartoon are fit for the internet but with a name like david lynch on it i expect better qualiti both in stori and in anim 
 
 
 
david lynch s crude and crude drawn take on south park present u with a nightmar of disturb clich s about suburban middl class famili the father is a hideous monster with three teeth and a disproportion larg circular mouth hole from which are utter the most horrend guttur nois the son and mother are perman horrifi incoher creatur for whom terror is a way of life a number of equal absurd charact are introduc throughout the seri lynch is not famous for his comedi i e on the air aspect of wild at heart and i am not particular fond of comedi in general howev there were a coupl of scene in dumbland which made me laugh out loud there are some clever bit of anim cinematographi where lynch convey wide rang of reaction in his charact through a syntact arrang of shot a oppos to facial express which never realli vari in dumbland i believ lynch wa realli tri to give his audienc a straight forward if disturb anim comedi here interest he chose to follow in the footstep of the recent wave of ultra low brow humor i e most will farrel film while ad element of vicious social critiqu and classic cartoon violenc and gross out humor while the blend doesn t realli work veri well here it is noth if not lynchian worth see by lynch fan 
 
 
 
let s be honest here the onli reason anyon bought this the onli reason anyon review this and the onli reason anyon could possibl claim to enjoy this is becaus david lynch made it and becaus you want to have david lynch s child but guess what even david lynch can produc a piec of crap mayb lynch want you to transcend normal and experi absurd in itself a a pure subject of know mayb the atroci cacophonist sound and chicken scratch visual are suppos to impli someth about human s place in the world about our relat to the real about the absurd of it all instead it just say one thing to me i just lost if i want offens for the sake of offens i could crank hansen on high and let me ear bleed if i want absurd for the sake of absurd i could just take a dump on a plate and watch that for minut there is a singl redeem qualiti to dumbland it is meta meta funni that is it is so bad that it isn t even funni becaus it s so bad this fact howev is a littl funni if you hate yourself and hate your money then buy dumbland if not spare yourself the agoni

ok i realli don t have too much to say about this film other than this i have seen over film in my life and more than of those were horror film while i have some difficulti decid which is the best a oppos to my favourit which i can tell you is georg a romero s dawn of the dead i can tell you without the slightest hesit that todd sheet zombi bloodbath is the absolut worst horror film i have ever seen there is simpli noth posit i can say about this film the act the dialogu the direct the make up the music everi aspect of this film is simpli so far below what is accept that it boggl my mind that this wa ever even releas even if you are a horror or zombi movi completist plea heed my warn and do not wast your time on this garbag there is no pleasur to be gotten from view this you won t even get ani laugh out of the utter ineptitud on display trust me plea 
 
 
 
if you haven t seen zombi bloodbath you haven t a contest like make your own horror movi in one day could not possibl come up with a entri than this outrag of an insult on ani viewer s intellig mr sheet forgot a stori a plot proper dialog the fact that peopl need some basic act talent and the credit light design obvious forgot to show up it seem to be record on the crummiest of handycam and copi on even wors equip make up effect consist of black mascara for the zombi and yoghurt be pour over peopl s head in order to simul their skin melt this is noth more than a home movi and a realli bad one a well onli fun to watch for the friend familymemb and neighbour that were will to show up for the film i cannot for the life of me understand whi this mockeri of a product is list in ani serious film magazin or websit i have home movi of wed parti that are way better and more interest a total wast of time money and energi the sequel zombi bloodbath ii is just more of the same rubbish 
 
 
 
while it contain fact that are not wide report it is not exact the truth they took a lot of liberti in rearrang event exclud peopl and use set that do not meet the fact of their live in the s there were more than just bonni clyde and w d in the gang at various time and those peopl had a much to do with the fact a those includ buck and blanch went to convinc clyde to go straight much earlier than the one shootout and in fact got drawn back into crime some of the event that were portray in daylight actual took place at night bonni s wound wa much more sever and never heal right it wa so bad she had to be carri around by someon until it heal up and even then it stiffen up so she walk stiffli clyde also walk with a limp becaus while in prison he cut off a big toe i know i m be nit picki and it wa a tv movi but even without these factual error in this true stori the movi move too fast from event to event and come across more a sever separ snapshot of their live rather than be a cohes flow stori i d recommend read a book or see a documentari if you want to get closer to the truth 
 
 
 
i thought hedi burress who manag to escap from the wateri grave of part one wa go to be in part guess not i just think they should of kill her off like in friday the th part you know what i mean this movi like scream and urban legend follow movi within a movi this wa pure crap the whole movi within a movi crap bad stay away

man what a scam this turn out to be not becaus it wasn t ani good a i wasn t realli expect anyth from it but becaus i wa misl by the dvd sleev which ignor parad it star a be stuart whitman stella steven and toni bill sure enough their name did not appear in the film s open credit much le themselv in the rest of it a it turn out the onli movi which connect those three actor togeth is the equal obscur la vega ladi but what that one ha to do with the crater lake monster is anybodi s guess even so sinc i paid for it rental and i wa in a monster movi mood anyhow i elect to watch the movi regardless and yup it stunk apart from the fact that it had a no name cast and an anonym crew an unmistak amateurish air wa visibl from mile away and the most i could do with it is laugh at the jaw like pretens and intent so at the resist antic of two moron layabout cum boat owner who frequent squabbl among themselv with the bemus local sheriff look on the creatur itself a plesiosaur i e half dinosaur half fish is imperfect realiz natur but a had been the case with the giant claw which i ve also just seen this didn t seem to bother the film maker none a they flaunt it a much a they can especi dure the movi s second half 
 
 
 
well what are the odd at the exact right moment that a few redneck amateur scientist discov cave paint indic that some type of dinosaur monster might have inhabit the area thousand of year ago a burn meteor crash into the lake and spontan hatch a monster s egg that ha been lie there for over a thousand year i suppos the crater lake monster is a movi that liter must be seen to be believ but you better do so in the compani of mani friend and a pile of ganja in order to make the wholesom a littl bit easier to digest yes this is a terribl film with the utmost ramshackl screenplay imagin and numer irrelev pad interlud that are downright embarrass but it s also irresist charm and so clumsili put togeth that you simpli have to cherish some kind of fond for it half of the film at least revolv on the wacki adventur of arni and mitch these two local yokel own and run a boat rent shop near the lake but spend most of their day pick their nose and quarrel over fascin stuff like to spell the word bait it is most dure their prototyp laurel hardi situat that new puddl of blood or decapit head are discov in the lake steve hanson the heroic but not exact sharp sheriff is on the case but onli if he s not too busi chase big citi thug travel through the area halfway through the film there sudden is an abrupt scene about a thug rob a liquor store and kill two peopl in the process this textbook wtf moment appear to take on the complet other side of the countri like in new york citi or someth and ha absolut noth to do with the event go on at crater lake onli like twenti minut later the robber pop up again in hicksvill and there s an exhilar chase through the wood end in the dino s hungri muzzl the absurd littl detail in the crater lake monster are too numer to mention for exampl this is probabl the onli creatur featur in which the player discov the obligatori gigant footprint after they alreadi spot the actual monster the goof in continu should be legendari a far a i m concern it s like everybodi forgot to pay attent to it night turn into twilight into day and back into twilight all dure one and the same diurnal cours the monster is undeni the best aspect about the film especi sinc it s accomplish through good old fashion and ador stop motion effect the cute critter is a plesiosaur mean an aquat dinosaur look like a crossbre between denver the last dinosaur and an allig crater lake monster is a uniqu and unforgett movi experi that i can onli encourag to track down the miser out of rate is just out of principl and becaus basic this is a veri bad film should be put into perspect becaus i might a well could have given it out of for sheer entertain valu 
 
 
 
 and how they bore you right out of your mind the crater lake monster is one of the classic bad film from the s made with no actor of ani note an embarrass script woeful direct and a tireless desir to fuse horror with light comedi this movi introduc a paleontologist who find draw of an aquat dinosaur underneath crater lake a meteor fall from the sky and an aquat dinosaur of the claymat varieti begin to terror and eat the inhabit surround crater lake the whole matter is taken care of by steve our local sheriff much of the film when not show pool of blood left behind from what we imagin must have been the beast dine is spent follow the bumbl antic of two guy name arni and mitch who run a boat rental place they tri so bad to be funni that we get line like look at a busi sign mitch say to arni you spell bait wrong it s spell b a t e the laugh were rather scarc here we then see them get drunk togeth and imagin a tree trunk to be the dinosaur laurel and hardi watch out the dinosaur look fake but the movi is fun in a bad way and at the veri least the lake is beauti 
 
 
 
return to cabin by the lake doe not in ani way stand up to the origin with onli one main charact stanley return for the sequal the film is not even worth the hour of your time i am a huge fan of the first film the stori line and act wa realli good but this is one movi that i will never again watch it is basic equal to what the sequal to urban legend and blair witch were like but with much wors act i ve person seen better act in soap opera it is so piti that you just have to laugh i in no way recommend this movi to anyon watch it will just detract from the first 
 
 
 
first i would like to point out that i onli know of the show due to my younger sister alway watch it i find it the most annoy program on tv there is noth funni about ani of the joke and the can laughter is unbear the show would work much better if film in front of a live audienc that way the laughter would show just how unfunni the show is howev i give credit to the act talent of the young cast it sicken me howev to think that they ll look back on the show in the futur and see how bad their first tv show wa the show link in well with the overal annoy voic and style of the cbbc present whi the youth of today need to be shout at so much is beyond me that is all 
 
 
 
stan laurel and oliv hardi are the most famous comedi duo in histori and deserv so so i am happi to see ani of their film basic a man at a horn factori is the fourth to crack and soon enough olli crack with all the horn nois he is rest at home with stan by his side need quiet and the doctor jame finlayson phone to say he is come over to check on olli after realis plumb and electr is muddl up by a cross eye repairman the doctor come in for a check up and after some test he recommend drink goat s milk and get some sea air on the ocean after stan practis some trumpet play hang out the window by the phone cord and a car crash he and olli to a dock to rent a boat they keep the boat on the dock tri to milk a goat and stan ha brought his trumpet meanwhil the newspap s front page read that killer nick grainger escap convict richard cramer ha escap and he sneak onto the boy boat while they are sleep and the goat chew through the boat rope drift out to sea in the morn the see their locat and the killer come out demand someth to eat and he spot stan and olli make fake food e g string for spaghetti soap for chees belt for bacon spong for meatbal and he forc them to eat it when olli start choke on someth stan blow his trumpet to help and olli s rage get him punch the killer and it keep go till the polic arriv onli to have olli s rage get them put in prison too there were the tiniest moment of comedi but it isn t a great black and white film well here s anoth nice mess you ve gotten me into wa number on year quot and stan laurel and oliv hardi were number on the comedian comedian okay 
 
 
 
sap at sea aspect ratio sound format mono black and white suffer from hornophobia olli embark on a rest boat trip but he and stan get mix up with an escap convict rychard cramer chao ensu this featur length comedi an ok entri which nonetheless unspool like a mere imit of laurel and hardi s best work mark the final collabor between l h and produc hal roach episod in structur the movi culmin in a memor ocean voyag after the boy are taken hostag by villain cramer who shoot a seagul to prove how tough he is the gag are ok but inspir is lack perhap due to the recruit of actor turn director gordon dougla previous respons for olli s first solo effort in the sound era zenobia produc in but whose work here lack a measur of pzazz fair but noth special l h regular charli hall and jame finlayson make guest appear 
 
 
 
i get the feel that the produc of this mess were out to make the most pain ridicul western ever made pain is the best word i can think of to describ it on the plus side you have nice color photographi and beauti and well spoken rhonda fleme my sympathi goe to jacqu aubuchon who play the crippl who act well enough in an annoy role written so atroci that no actor could give an enjoy perform the product valu were quit good which onli serv to highlight the terribl stori and screenplay thing i hate stewart granger look so littl like a western figur what with his british accent neat tailor outfit and silli immacul alway white kerchief tie around his neck it got tiresom the way the townspeopl and his son were constant harangu and insult granger and he never spoke up or repli back i know we are suppos to suspend disbelief and appreci western a symbol moral play but this one broke the spell with it laughabl unrealist and predict scene the worst be at the end where granger miracul speedili and singl hand plant dynamit around a canyon pas that the bad guy s cattl will pas through and then granger plant himself in the perfect spot so he can shoot the dynamit from a veri far distanc to creat rock slide to buri and spook the cattl and bad guy seem destroy them all save the two main bad guy next worst is everyth about the plot which is load with soap opera scene noth in the movi seem believ i couldn t believ what all the conflict wa about the bad guy wa drive his herd through to market and want the cow to chew some grass along the way i don t see whi someth couldn t have been work out you need a land ownership disput for that don t bother to see it 
 
 
 
let me start out by say that i use to realli like betti grabl particular from down argentin way but by the time she got around to this disast she had also got round and frank the whole film wa an embarrass costar with dougla fairbank jnr who must have been fair desper the stori wa bad the colour good and the film far too long it had some of the old standbi in it like harri davenport and reginald gardin to tri and stimul interest but with no success the music score wa woeful and i have to say not one tune wa memor in ani way a i wa such a fan of miss grabl i alway wish i had never seen this one

a decent sequel but doe not pack the punch of the origin a murder screenwrit judd nelson assum new ident in order to direct his own novel cabin by the lake still ruthless kill but movi seem veri tongu in cheek ani humor is not of the funni kind total project seem to have the qualiti of a quicki and at time nelson is way over the top this movi is about a script be rewritten befor go to the screen this should have happen to this script 
 
 
 
well mayb i m just have a bad run with hindi movi late i ask the video store guy for apharan prakash jha but be a new releas wasn t avail yet so i had to settl for this one it turn out to be the stupidest hindi movi i ve seen and i ve seen quit a few no wonder bollywood is the laugh stock of the whole world if imdb had negat rate i would give garam masala a i rememb see a tv show about the jazzi premier they had for it releas in mumbai all the usual celeb and their sidey show up for some strang reason peopl expect good stuff from piyadarashan i did not like hulchul hungama or his other film hulchul probabl dub from tamil or telugu came across a veri loud in your face fare that again didn t make much sen except in a bollywood flick this latest piec of utter cxxp prove that this guy ha no brain who made him a director even a bollywood director at that anyhow to the film now what start off a a romant escapad turn into a non sensic woman hunt two fashion photograph work for a magazin share an apart isn t it similar to no entri where the dude work for a gossip magazin and share an offic jezuz christ now they re copi their own stori well anyway there s some cook or chef that tri to help one of the dodo in his quest for multi later love aka multi task multi time what happen in the end i ve no idea i switch off mid way what ridicul junk i can t believ they even releas it and how sadist to wallow in their own filth for which audienc did they make it the poor illiter indian mass mil at last count or the well heel nri desi stay in phoren either way it doesn t matter neither group ha ani clue what make a good movi and probabl deserv such god aw stuff it a short review becaus there s noth to write about but the usual bag of f grade garbag bollywood should chang it name to follywood and yes this review is much better than the movi itself 
 
 
 
it begin on a nice note onli to falter quick and let down expect mac akshay kumar and sam s john abraham charact are not proper built befor mac s bos decid to hitch him with three air hostess rest of the drama is about how mac sam and uncl mambo paresh rawal deal with situat which at time seem forc about the cast paresh rawal is a veri talent actor i thought wa wast in the role of a moodi cook akshay kumar is toler john abraham is veri bad keep stumbl over furnitur rajpal yadav is the onli save grace in the movi the second half of the movi is funni at time but in all a dud song are bore and a major let down if you are hope for some wholesom entertain and comedi 
 
 
 
do not wast your time with this movi this is a total thrash in term of act direct sound edit soundtrack there wa such a wast of perform by some of the veri good actor the movi doe not do justic to paresh rawal who is perhap one of the most talent actor in bollywood akshay kumar who is also an emerg star did quit a poor job john abraham what is wrong with him is that what you call act i mean he should thank god that he ha a pretti face otherwis he d be win razzi award in india if there were ani such award in bollywood asrani a great talent but overdo his bit a befor screenplay which wa not to mention a rip off from the s boe boe wa quit bad frame first of all peopl in bollywood just can t make someth origin on top of that they don t even know how to copi well the joke in the movi were so overdon it wa get pain to sit through them priyadarshan may be a star in the south but he s just not fit to make a decent hindi movi the sound edit is amaz crappi i can go on and on this matter but the bottom line is that bollywood should be shame of make such a film the worst part is that some peopl seem to love this movi what is wrong with you guy this is the reason whi bollywood is where it is did you know that bollywood make more movi than hollywood everi year howev most of the movi are unheard of abroad becaus of movi like this one i am an indian and i am utter shame of bollywood for produc this piec of thrash movi like dil chahta hai and lagaan were just terrif they are world class film which are timeless among the best of this decad garam masala howev is perhap one of the worst of this centuri period i give it a out of 
 
 
 
i have to say that this wa the worst film of priyadarshan releas alongsid much better kyonki which wa also his directori ventur it contain no specif storylin and just focus on bodi show by debut actress and some silli comedi sequenc i think priyadarshan is becom too much repetit in his comedi flick just like govinda and david dhavan had done in the past after give some good entertain they also went on to loo their audienc so it will be good for him to concentr more on script and tri some variat in his direct give u more of herapheri s and malam week s rather than give dud like garam masala 
 
 
 
watch on hulu far too mani commerci so it broke the pace but even still it wa like watch a realli bad buddi movi from the earli sixti dean martin and jerri lewi where both part are play by jerri lewi if i were indian i d protest the portray of all male a venal and all woman a shrew they cheat for the music video for western sale and use a lot of western model so the male could touch them i usual enjoy indian film a lot but this wa a major disappoint especi for a modern indian film the stori doesn t take place in india the uncl keep refer to when mac will return to india but i can t find out where it is suppos to be happen 
 
 
 
i never understood whi some peopl dislik bollywood film they ve got charismat actor great danc number and heighten emot what s not to like what i didn t realiz wa that i had onli seen the upper crust of bollywood then i watch garam masala i could tell from the first scene that this wa not a movi i wa go to like the film open with a montag of the two lead drive around a citi and appar happen serendipit on a seri of photo setup popul with gyrat model but i kept hope thing would improv sad they didn t the main problem is that the two protagonist mac sam are complet unsympathet they spend the entir movi lie to woman and lie brutal in order to get them into bed and the audienc is suppos to find this funni and be charm the boy are unscrupul and inept and not in a lovabl way mac even goe so far a to have one of the woman drug in order to keep her from discov his cheat the script is extrem poor with repetit scene setup that never lead to anyth and illog action and statement by the charact in fact the charact are never realli develop at all the male are boorish greedi jerk and the woman mere interchang beauti if you go by this movi you would think that air hostess are pretti easi to pas from man to man in realiti betray is not so humor the onli bright spot i found in the movi were one danc number that had brilliant set and a few slapsticki moment involv the french farc door slam aspect of the stori but bollywood danc is better enjoy in movi choreograph by farah khan and for slapstick you might a well just go straight to the silent comedi of buster keaton and harold lloyd who seem to have influenc writer director priyadarshan not a littl priyadarshan also take fals credit for invent the stori the basic premis of the plot is stolen from the play boe boe the origin author of that work marc camoletti is credit nowher at least priyadarshan chang the titl for this remak rather than brazen use the origin without give credit a he did in his version of this same tale accord to imdb s credit list 
 
 
 
dietrich bonhoeff s write have had a profound influenc on my life a a christian and i eager anticip watch this movi and find out more about his life word can hard express my disappoint this movi wa disjoint it gave no background about his life no histor context and noth about his great write except a brief pas refer to the cost of discipleship by a colleagu at the begin of the movi instead we see him enjoy jazz appar in the state and chill out with his friend befor he decid to go back to germani appar to show his human side ok i m readi for the dramat part the part where he stand up for his faith instead of emphas that we get a veri bad act romanc with a year old schoolgirl whether or not that actual took place it should not have been a major portion of the movi now still wait for the dramat part or some narrat explain what his write were all about or someth to make u know a littl bit of the great of this man drum roll wait wait zip nada this is the kind of movi that give christian film a bad name all they had to do wa set up a structur for the movi to follow with some background even some voic over or flashback to him preach from his work some narrat about who he wa and where he had been but no this is what we got hard fit for a hero of the faith 
 
 
 
this film is not devoid of charm and also show a bit of warmth but ultim this effort is too vain and too strong focus on the lead there is no doubt that mari tyler moor know what to do with all her screen time but she take too much of the limelight away from the rest of the cast anoth problem is the overburden of the script with clich the daughter who secret drop out of colleg an older woman find it difficult to get a good job and first end up with fair demean work the sleazi network execut with his execut toy who goe for glitz over substanc the journalist who stick up for her belief etc there is noth realli wrong with ani of these i e they are all firm root in realiti but in combin they are just too much and leav u with too much deja vu and too few surpris 
 
 
 
on the back burner for year so it wa report this televis reunion of two of the most belov charact in sitcom histori start off bad and went straight downhil from there mari richard mari tyler moor and her best friend rhoda morgenstern valeri harper meet in new york after a long estrang and catch up on each other s live what a novel concept but sad to relat noth worth talk about let alon make a movi about ha happen to either of them in the interven year so instead the script content itself with throw out one hoari old plot devic after anoth most have to do with older woman in the workplac while complet miss the quirki charm and sophist that made the origin show a winner the support cast is instant forgett the humor is nonexist and the chemistri which moor and harper onc had togeth is gone moor alleg stall this project for year wait for just the right script befor commit herself if this wa the one she consid right what on earth were the one she turn down like it s not the age of the charact that doe this in for time inevit march on but the almost complet lack of imagin coupl with a blatant disregard for the element that made the seri work at one time this wa intend a a pilot but all to obvious it fail to generat ani interest among potenti sponsor or for that matter among potenti audienc quick and merci forgotten the film is a travesti and an insult to a classic 
 
 
 
if you haven t seen this yet i say just move on take a walk in the park don t wast your time neither the scenario nor the act is worth your money spoiler i can t decid which wa wors the movi itself or baldwin s hairstyl ellen pompeo s act talent is veri question i hope she can improv it over time the storylin is just unbeliev loo cannon american cop fight crimin in europ on his own infam slavic mafioso protect by onli two hunk an emot art teacher lead a ruthless gang spanish polic execut dumber than a sack of hammer give me a break there s onli one good thing about this movi though at least the product cost must be lower than ocean s s which wa a meaningless and over the top a this one 
 
 
 
this effort wa like a glitzi tv movi i don t recal this ever be releas in theater if so it must ve die a quick death watch the dvd in the comfort of our bedroom it wa obvious this film wa meant for not much more ed lauter an art critic with a greed streak what a fun turn that must ve been i haven t seen ed sinc the longest yard everyon el pretti much act by the number led by baldwin except for pompeo she had zero charisma and seem to be sleepwalk thru most of the pictur pompeo s daughter had one dimens she play everi scene like a lovabl littl puppi slowest line deliveri of ani year old i ve seen yet the chase scene gave my wife and i headach too much quick cut and angl bash if you re go to shoot a chase scene in barcelona you might want a few wide shot to exploit the beauti of your backdrop right the whole stori wa pretti implaus and far fetch but hey we like it better than the life aquat 
 
 
 
i watch cabin by the lake this afternoon on usa consid this movi wa made for tv is wa interest enough to watch the sequel so i tune in for the air this even and wa extrem disappoint i knew i wouldn t like the movi but i wa not expect to be perplex by the use of dv digit video the movi would have been toler if it wasn t for these juxtapos digit shot that seem to come from nowher i expect the plot line to be tie in with these shot but there seem to be no logic explan warn the follow mayb a spoiler the open end in cabin by the lake wa accept but the open end on the sequel is ridicul i can onli forese return of return to the cabin by the lake be watch abl is if the movi wa shown up against noth but infomerci at o clock in the morn 
 
 
 
first i realiz that a rate is suppos to be reserv for the worst of the worst this movi get that from me becaus a one review point out it s not bad in a self awar over the top sort of way that might allow it to have some comic or cult valu it simpli miss it mark on everi count contain possibl spoiler the dialog is complet disingenu the continu is so deliber it s pain daniel just finish speak of his lost love and with his final word the flamenco dancer start the mock shock of what s her name see i don t even rememb her charact s name let alon the name of the forgett actress when her husband the baldwin first tell her that her friend is the bad guy the car and the motorcycl chase did all the right thing veget cart gone fli car crash into each other motorcycl go down the stair peopl near be hit but remark no one is oh that s right except for the one guy who ha been stab sever time is obvious stumbl along the curb with knife wound and an approach car appar didn t notic him there hmmm it s becom more and more remark to me that movi like this can be made there is so much pressur in the film industri to make money you d think that someon in hollywood would think of make good film worth see now there s a novel idea my suggest don t see this film don t rent the dvd don t watch it on cabl there are lot of other thing you could be do that will leav you feel more satisfi 
 
 
 
this film seem to be a rip off of mani movi that have dealt with the same subject in the past let the futur viewer be forewarn that art heist doesn t add anyth to the genr director bryan goer ha no clue what to do with the film william baldwin keep reappear in film and frank one wonder if he ha a great agent or is it that director and produc love his unusu goofi look compliment by that strang hairdo he sport in most of his movi the onli good movi in which he ha appear is the squid and the whale in which he onli speak two or three line ellen pompeo his lead ladi doesn t fare much better there is no chemistri between m pompeo and mr baldwin a movi to be seen at the viewer s own risk 
 
 
 
although in mani way i agre with the other review comment i find that the plot and idea are veri good mani of the support actor were veri good the fatal problem with this film is ellen pompeo i am sure i have never seen a le talent actor how this person ha ever been in a film or on televis i cannot imagin in my opinion she would be better a a greater at a wal mart to see a person with this low level of talent involv in pay role doe beg the question who doe she know i would veri much like to see this film re made with some talent i do not fault the writer for the failur of this film to be worth the time to view it 
 
 
 
one may ask whi the charact snarl yell and chew the sceneri without ani percept reason except someon want to make a movi in barcelona billi baldwin is that the right one is forgett in the cop estrang husband love father of cute littl blond girl role the stori seem to have been cut and past from the scene thrown away from adventur film in the last three year ellen pompeo s lack of charisma is a black hole that seem to suck the energi out of everi scene she is in her true act rang is display when she take her blous off a the movi careen from one limp chase scene to anoth unfortun the direct rare goe bad enough to be camp or a parodi it is all just clich familiar in everi respect the director cast his own daughter a the precoci brat probabl becaus no respect agent would have permit a client to ruin a career by be in such a lame contriv and uninterest movi the onli heist here is the theft of the investor s money and the viewer s time 
 
 
 
 i saw this on the sci fi channel it came on right after the first one for some reason this movi kept me interest i don t know whi stop ask spoiler okay it wa cheesi how this guy got involv with the make of the movi in the first movi he had a reason to kill peopl but in this sequal half of the kill attempt kill were basic for no reason stanley kill the director due to creativ differ he captur the co writer due to creativ differ but what wa the deal with tri to kill off the cast no cast no movi he want it to look real when they die if this wa suppos to be such a high budget movi use the special effect man of cours like the first one the captur girl get away and stanley end up get mess up and dissapear woooooow sarcasm this movi had potenti and the saddest thing of all the realli sad part i would watch a cabin by the lake onli becaus i like judd nelson and he s the onli good part about this sequal 
 
 
 
my wife and i both agre that this is one of the worst movi ever made certain in the top ten of those i ve watch all the way through at least plan wa enjoy i did realli enjoy christin the dead zone firestart carri and some of his other film i didn t care much for cujo onli becaus the sound wa so bad on version i ve seen and i often couldn t tell what peopl were say or pet sematari pet cemeteri but this mess wa a total mistak in everi way possibl the creatur themselv seem design by a year old no offens to year old even the one liner made u groan and weren t remot amus 
 
 
 
 sleepwalk is the first film which stephen king ha written a script for given this and the excel santo johnni song that they use a the theme of the movi you would be expect a odd and ultim fulfil view experi unfortun that s not what you d be get the thing is they could have probabl made it a good movi the begin is intrigu what with it s small town spooki atmospher but someth strang happen about minut into the film the film turn funni for no appar reason from that moment on the whole atmospher of sleepwalk is ruin for those of you who have seen it who can ever forget good old johnni scream out cop kabob after jab the pencil into that one cop s ear but don t get me wrong the humor ha no redeemi qualiti i just rent it again to see if maby i wa wrong the first time around given how origin the plot sound but i wa right man what a wast i can t believ they got the right to that santo johnni song i gave this a 
 
 
 
this film ha it share of negat comment and i have to agre with those who consid it one of the worst movi ever made true most of the film base on the work of king are pretti bad but this one goe beyond bad into the realm of horribl there is not one scari moment in it unless you consid stupid scari it is typic king garbag myth twist around that made no sen in the first place mix with obvious and belabor so call scare that are about a shock a peewe s playhous which at least is entertain it is full of ridicul moment not the least of which is alic krige s charact when she goe on a rampag and start quip like the villain in an old batman tv show it is so absurd a to be sicken all the peopl who had cameo in this includ john landi are lucki they still have career but the most absurd part ha to be the cat costum toward the end which look like cheap rubber outfit someon bought at k mart the best part of the movi is the appear of some real cat who actual out act the peopl in the movi 
 
 
 
i have noth against a fast pace fright flick but this stephen king deriv nonsens is too fresh scrub too bright and modern the plot about a new teenag boy in a small town who is a sleepwalk sort of a cross between a vampir and a werewolf and who feed on the blood of femal virgin beg for a more mysteri ambigu treatment this thriller is given an inappropri color look and feel with hard ani atmospher the kid are predict pretti and energet but the big plus is alic kridg a the boy s mother kridg from ghost stori never broke out of the filler femal mold and it s a huge loss that she hasn t been use more her perform is creepi and intens and give hint that sleepwalk might ve been a much better film with a differ focus and tighter direct it s too over the top and commerci driven with an uneven tone that swing wild from thriller to comedi to drama stephen king pop up in a cameo a do real life director john landi and tobe hooper from 
 
 
 
it could have been a marvel stori base on the ancient race of cat peopl but it wasn t this work could have been just that marvel and replet with mytholog refer which kept my fascin fuel the lead charact charl bradi play by brian kraus and his mother mari play by alic krige were shallowli done had no depth of person and were hard likabl or draw not even m dchen amick who play tanya robertson s charact fit into that descript howev a i ve said mani time befor when you adapt a stephen king novel for tv you simpli must take into account the fact that his book aren t written for tv and his screenplay talent sad lack the fire and depth he exhibit a a novelist this is anoth botch attempt to take the magick of stephen king write whether that is of his novel or an origin screenplay to simpli cut and past his work onto the small screen his novel get complet bastard in the process and all you end up creat is a nice movi noth le but certain noth more his screenplay are hit and miss unfortun this screenplay translat wa a miss sorri sorri sorri movi this movi get a from the fiend 
 
 
 
a charm boy and his mother move to a middl of nowher town cat and death soon follow them that about sum it up i ll admit that i am a littl freak out by cat after see this movi but in all serious in spite of the numer thing that are wrong with this film and believ me there is plenti of that to go around it is overal a veri enjoy view experi the charact are more like caricatur here with onli their basi instinct to reli on fear greed pride lust or anger seem to be all that motiv these peopl although it can be argu that that seem fail in actual serv the tell of the stori the supernatur premis and the fact that it is a stephen king screenplay not that i have anyth specif against mr king are quit nice support by some interest fx work makeup and quit suitabl music the absolut gem of this film is without a doubt alic krige who play mari bradi the otherworld mother king manag to take a simpl stori of outsid or peopl who are a littl differ okay a lot in this case tri to fit in and twist it into a campi over the top littl horror gem that ha to be in the collect of ani horror fan 
 
 
 
there are no spoiler here becaus there is no plot to spoil madchen amick is live proof a face can make a live act no talent requir the onli bright spot are a few realli good one liner deliv veri nice by alic krige but then again she is alic krige her soft dreami voic give the onli hint at just how seduct danger these odd creatur can be she is believ creepi in this otherwis unbeliev plot how they got her to agre to this project remain a mysteri the screenplay writer must have been medic when they submit this script it ha major continu problem superfici stereotyp charact horror formula write and simpli fall short of make ani sen what so ever the creatur while they have neat skill like go dim the question of where they come from and what they are is never so much explor don t wast ani time on this one 
 
 
 
ok i tape this off tv and miss the veri start the film wa about or so second into the titl i assum so if anyth happen befor that i miss it lot of peopl say mark hammil is in this i didn t see him i did recognis clive barker john landi and obvious stephen king do some realli aw act a the graveyard attend alic krige look love apart from the scene where she ha the cat face or is in full alien make up even with the open titl it s never realli explain veri well exact what sleepwalk are or where they come from from the titl sequenc i assum they are catlik bipe who live by extract life forc from human i assum they live a long time and these particular are possibl the last of their kind add to this a veri larg dose of incest yes i thought it wa a bit suspect too shapeshift killer cat and invis and you have sleepwalk it s a veri bad stori that ha no real explan behind the main charact and far too mani cameo s to tri and distract from the simpl fact that not enough is explain to the viewer avoid 
 
 
 
 and after see this pile of crap you won t be surpris that it wasn t publish spoiler this is a terribl movi by ani standard but when i point out that it s one of the worst movi that ha the name stephen king in the credit you can start to imagin how bad it is the movi start of with two charact stare open mouth at a scene of horror my god what happen here i don t know but they sure hate cat the camera pan to the outsid of a hous where hundr of cat are strung up dead and mutil boy this guy is right someon doe hate cat and with a deduct like that he should be a policeman oh wait a minut he is a policeman and when a movi start with a cop make an oh so obvious observ you just know you re go to be watch a bad movi the reason sleepwalk is bad is that it s veri illog and confus we eventu find out the monster of the titl need the blood of virgin to surviv would they not be better look for a virgin in the mid west bibl belt rather than an american coastal town have said that at least we know of the monster motiv that s the onli thing we learn we never learn how they re abl to chang shape or are abl to make car becom invis and this jar with the end that seem to have been stolen from the termin monster mother walk around kill sever cop with her bare hand or blow them up via a polic issu hand gun but if her monster breed is immun from polic fire power then whi do the creatur need the abil to chang shape or becom invis the demis of the creatur is equal ill thought out a there kill by a mass attack of household cat if they can be kill by cat then whi did the monster not kill all the cat that were lie around the garden there wa a whole hord of moggi sit around but the monster never thought about kill them i guess that s so the product team can come up with an end it wa that they start the movi my complaint lie we re treat to sever scene where famous horror movi director like john landi clive barker and even stephen king make cameo i think the reason for this is becaus whenev a struggl unknown actor read the script they instant decid that no matter what they weren t go to appear in a movi this bad so stephen king had to phone up his horror buddi in order to fill out the cast that s how bad sleepwalk is unbeliev a it seem that wasn t the worst line in the movi the worst line is that cat save my life 
 
 
 
give credit where it s due onli the technicolor costum and set deserv ani honor mention this is undoubt the lowest point in bing crosbi s long career at paramount the script is about a clumsi a you could possibl imagin and neither the casual bing nor william bendix nor sir cedric hardwick can do a thing about repair it bendix look extrem foolish in a page boy wig and poor rhonda fleme ha a stock costum heroin role requir her to look ador at bing and littl el except for warbl a coupl of uninspir ballad in a voic probabl dub for the occas just plain aw mark twain s wit is not evid in ani of the screenplay onli die hard crosbi fan can possibl appreci this mess of a film given uninspir direct even the extra look a though they don t know what they re suppos to be do sum up dull a dishwat not recommend even for child 
 
 
 
what s with the murki video in the begin and sporad throughout the movi it s like someon put muddi water on the camera len the violenc and nuditi might turn some peopl off but that along with the most bad act is what make a good cult movi i suppos my favorit line is deliv by tarquin the vampir ala your breed is dumb okay no one should ever say ala in a movi line unless they re english and live in the th centuri the act by the van hel charact and bad girl ralli isn t bad i also like master littl play by ron littl wick martial art don t take it too serious and you ll enjoy it 
 
 
 
an interest concept vampir have someth to do with a virus but done sever time by now overal the movi is too long and drag a bit the edit could have been tighter i am sorri to hear about the problem with the credit mayb the movi wa rush to market the light wa too dark in place but the worst technic problem is the audio the level wa good enough to hear the dialog but mani of the interior have a echo sound to them which is veri distract either they were not care in the record or the sound mix could have been better also too much background nois got through the should have gotten someon to do sound effect for the martial art scene the tinni clank of sword hit togeth wa not the sound of an epic battl especi in the combat scene the edit need to be tighter also the act wa a bit flat i am sorri but when i see that the same person write and star in a movi in my experi it is a red flag but it wa a good effort so i gave it a 
 
 
 
how can a movi have ozzi osbourn and still suck i just don t get it trick or treat manag to do it this suck and like it trick or treat is one of those movi i have to warn peopl about it is a vomit induc vile atroc just beg to be view so you can feel that much wors about yourself trick or treat ha no redeem factor for a movi about heavi metal it sure doesn t seem to grasp what heavi metal is or what it repres this movi manag to make heavi metal look lame and this wa in probabl one of heavi metal s strongest hour that is quit a feat howev negat trick or treat so bad you will be angri at yourself for have watch it that simpl equat will hope keep you away from this brainless and gutless film 
 
 
 
nine minut of psychedel pulsat often symmetr abstract imag are enough to drive anyon crazi i did spot a full frame eye at the start and later some bird silhouet against other color it wa just not my cup of tea it s about minut too long 
 
 
 
this movi doe not rock a other have said i found it realli bore and silli the stori is about this metal high school kid who idol this realli bad heavi metal singer the singer die but not befor make one last album that is to be play over the radio at of cours midnight on halloween which would actual make it novemb st a much le potent date to be sure the kid get a copi of the record and it contain secret hidden back play messag it also is the key that open the door so that the realli bad metal singer can return to bring havoc and death to the world the first part of this film is not a horror film at all but rather an after school special we see the metal kid the outsid torment over and over by the popular kid and he fail to learn the most import lesson in high school movi when the cool kid who bulli you sudden invit you to a parti don t go it is a trap especi if it is a pool parti anybodi surpris when he end up in the water it wa such an after school special that i kept wait for melissa sue anderson to show up and teach jodi foster a lesson so back to the horror part of the film so this metal kid get some power and instead of use them to kill the bulli boy which would have made much more sen he freak out and tri to protect all of the bulli boy and girl from harm what a sensit hero what fun is that in a horror movi thank good carri white did not follow this lesson he actual tri to prevent have the music play at the halloween danc the veri music that could unleash a power to kill all the kid who had been mean to him if it were me i would have put that music on and pronto the rest of the movi is about this metal kid go around town tri to kill the horribl metal star he idol whi not partner with him and realli do some damag whi you ask it seem he is in love with one of the popular girl and doe not want her hurt more appropri for a molli ringwald film is this a horror film or an episod of beauti and the beast the movi just goe on and on at this point with no scare horror or anyth worth watch if you went to high school in the late s like i did this movi is fun to have a littl flashback to fashion and big hair but that is it for this film skip it and stay home and just listen to some kiss 
 
 
 
a bad one oh my this is one of the movi which doesn t have even one posit effect just everyth from actor to stori stink to the sky i just wonder how low i q you should have to watch this kind of flick and even enjoy is there someth than this is worth watch for well there is a lot of nuditi involv but it s noth particular and when you just think that it couldn t get wors your realiz that all the nake ladi look like there are forti year old c mon guy where did you search for these actress in elder home perhap anyway the lead actress ha some sex appeal and know how to show it again too bad that she is too skinni old all in all skip these one out of
