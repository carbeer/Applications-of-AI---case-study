saw movie sneak preview must honestly confess like films meryl streep much picture worst half theatre return break halfway film couldnt blame true story absolutely need second half picture film goes forward time ten years expecting credits appear
saw shelf local video store saw coppola credits got excited one time movie raised interest could never quite work attempt humourous film failed miserably attempt serious film failed miserably general entire production seemed incredibly amatuerish sound particular absolutely dreadful especially scenes shot little bar dialogue corny parts unbelievable disappointing
jack black annoying character annoying indie movie year olds write eight lines ana de la reguera dang fine look mexican nun puts rather forward rude advances jack black movie pg version indie film really like movie courage explore mexican culture movie explores mexican culture deeply choke cultural rudeness jack black rude white person like jack black valuable emissary mexican culture mexican wrestling culture diaphanous venue white guy could seek suspect mexico culturally opaque jack black presented think imdb changed review anyone else review changed well question
mean really either suddenly lost sense humor really bad movie stupid ridiculous funny since saw preview knew going great movie think gonna bad happened good old times could find clever funny lines movie actors play ridiculous roles attempt funny find movies like one borat little men scary movie could find funny parts skip piece garbage p sorry english
sure deep recesses jack blacks mind character nacho libre absolutely hilarious tell ol jacks whale time hammin playing smarmy slimy mexican friar dreams becoming wrestler movie total misfire every single department sat movie thinking supposed funny guy tenacious right truth film nothing offer lousy script crappy characters really naff acting direction watch endless moments think something funny surely happen bored stupid minutes though would surely pick minutes later barely managed stave aneurism painful like remember years ago see anything fave actor even really early pap famous really embarrassed said actor actually load plop yeah like enjoyed jack black earlier movies like shallow hall really looking forward seeing pick destiny come man us jack gonna come round hammer kneecaps something least give serious talking know clich one worst movies ever seen many reasons
jack black usually make snicker simply breathing movie besides direction writing lack plot constant mugging aided abetted constant straight camera shots joke batting average still utter waste time idea sounds promising potential gets wasted utter lack comedy worst direction seen side tube kept hearing film portrayed mexicans negatively doubt true really think movie meant racist think result creative team desperately trying find something funny mess almost hear crying behind camera hey look ugly mexican laugh people please love things tenacious laugh put racism charges aside get anyone plunked good money time watch pile leftover refried beans offended imo

 people know clunker one root one care despite game efforts talented cast pacino delivers usual tour de force eli wurman past prime publicity agent hollowed lifetime moral corruption unlike michael corleone impossible emotional investment character dilemma fate film traces eli preparations benefit liberal political cause distracted client ryan neal good underwritten part latest dirty laundry case tv actress companion gotten involved wrong people tea leoni brings customary star power supporting role although script give much work eli sister law kim basinger manages evoke sympathy despite implausible plot mechanics movie strictly like watching pacino strut stuff enjoy principals unfortunately script direction people know strictly amateurish hence limited theatrical release speedy journey dvd consider warned

really terrible redeeming feature movie next time people ask worst vampire movie ever watched would suitable reply think filmed mm already tacky like hell bothered commenting noticed fanboys probably connected movie claimed best movie since matrix let debunk myths lies nothing good movie everything yells tacky actress ugly fight choreography worst ever seen fight scenes unbelievably amateurish imagine girl flailing arms around circle helplessly delivering weak kicks hurt kitten obviously director pulled people street give roles movie know director much budget movie still better movies made smaller budget unforgivable
 friend mine enjoys watching worst films possibly find good laugh watching told puts one forced give good kicking knows serious
know type person watches even worst movies finish often sheer morbid curiosity even watched leprechaun end giving temptation tearing eyes stamping also know movie vcr less half hour made frantic leap stop button dashed back rental store put much distance possible
words fail film extremely difficult watch hindsight really wish done although attempted sit end credits admit last hour opinion could unfair however film would require impressive final third history film making order given review anything vicious please watch part film
may seen worse films remember possibly blocked knows undergo hypnotherapy may remember along maybe abducted aliens child traumas would happily exchange memories ones watching film give film credit produce emotional response actually started become angry scenes spoofed films tv programs travesty dirtying association terrified may unable watch films like dr strangelove without film flitting across minds eye
